# SaveManager Removal and Integration

## Summary
Removed the original monolithic SaveManager.js file and fully integrated the new modular save system. Updated all references to use the new file structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Original File
- Deleted `/js/core/SaveManager.js`

### 2. Updated References
- Updated service-worker.js to include all new save system files
- Verified that all imports are now pointing to the new save system

### 3. New Structure Integration
The game now uses the following modular save system:

```
js/core/save/
├── index.js                      # Main exports
├── ISaveSystem.js                # Interface for save systems
├── IStorageAdapter.js            # Interface for storage adapters
├── LocalStorageAdapter.js        # Implementation for localStorage
├── SaveManager.js                # Main implementation
├── serializers/
│   ├── PlayerSerializer.js       # Player data serialization
│   ├── QuestSerializer.js        # Quest data serialization
│   ├── SettingsSerializer.js     # Game settings serialization
│   └── WorldSerializer.js        # World data serialization
└── utils/
    └── SaveUtils.js              # Utility functions
```
