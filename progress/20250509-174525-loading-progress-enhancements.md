# Loading Progress Enhancements

## Overview
This update significantly improves the loading progress indicator to provide a more accurate and smoother experience, especially for ES module loading which was previously not being properly tracked.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Progress Bar Stuck at 0%
- Fixed an issue where the progress bar would stay at 0% and then suddenly jump to 100%
- Implemented a more sophisticated tracking system for different resource types
- Added special handling for ES modules which are loaded dynamically

### 2. Module Loading Not Tracked
- Added specific detection and tracking for ES module scripts
- Pre-registered expected module files to show progress before they're actually loaded
- Implemented simulated gradual loading of modules to provide visual feedback

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Added immediate visual feedback with initial progress simulation
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for slow connections
- Added acceleration of progress for very slow loads to avoid user frustration

## Implementation Details

1. **Resource Type Tracking**:
   - Categorized resources by type (HTML, CSS, JS, modules, images, fonts)
   - Assigned appropriate weights to each resource type
   - Calculated weighted progress based on the importance of each resource type

2. **ES Module Handling**:
   - Added specific detection for module scripts
   - Pre-registered common module files to track
   - Implemented simulated loading for modules that can't be directly tracked

3. **Smoother Progress Visualization**:
   - Added initial progress simulation to provide immediate feedback
   - Implemented gradual loading simulation with random delays
   - Added fallback mechanisms to ensure progress always moves forward

4. **Robustness Improvements**:
   - Added multiple safety checks and fallbacks
   - Improved error handling for edge cases
   - Implemented timeout-based progress acceleration for slow connections

## Benefits

- Users see a smooth, continuous progress indication during loading
- Progress bar accurately reflects the loading of different resource types
- ES modules (which make up a significant portion of the loading time) are now properly tracked
- Improved perception of loading speed through better visual feedback

## Technical Notes

- Used Performance API to track resource loading
- Implemented weighted progress calculation based on resource types
- Added simulation for resources that can't be directly tracked
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
