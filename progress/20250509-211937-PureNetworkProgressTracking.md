# Pure Network Progress Tracking Implementation

## Summary
Completely redesigned the loading progress system to rely solely on actual network activity rather than simulations. The system now uses the Performance Observer API to track real downloads and only uses the file-sizes.json for the total expected download size.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `scripts/generate-file-sizes.js`:
- Simplified to focus only on calculating total file size and basic category statistics
- Removed detailed file-by-file tracking, keeping only minimal sample files for compatibility
- Added category size summaries for informational purposes

### 2. Simplified `fetchFileSizesFromServiceWorker()` in `pwa/initial-load-progress.js`:
- Now only extracts the total file size from file-sizes.json
- Removed all file category and individual file size processing
- Logs category statistics for debugging but doesn't use them for tracking

### 3. Completely rewrote `trackProgressWithFileSize()` in `pwa/initial-load-progress.js`:
- Now relies 100% on actual network events via Performance Observer API
- Determines file categories dynamically based on file extensions
- Shows real-time progress based on actual downloaded bytes vs. total expected size
- Displays the actual files being downloaded as they happen
- Removed all simulation code and predefined loading speeds

## Benefits

1. **True Network Progress Tracking:**
   - Progress now reflects actual network activity with no simulation
   - Users see exactly which files are being downloaded in real-time
   - Progress percentage is based on actual downloaded bytes vs. total size

2. **Simplified Implementation:**
   - No need to maintain detailed file lists in file-sizes.json
   - File categories are determined dynamically based on file extensions
   - Reduced complexity and maintenance overhead

3. **Better User Experience:**
   - More accurate loading information
   - Real-time feedback on download progress
   - Transparent loading process showing actual files being downloaded

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses the Performance Observer API to monitor resource downloads:

```javascript
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
    list.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.entryType === 'resource') {
            const url = entry.name;
            const transferSize = entry.transferSize || 0;
            
            // Process the downloaded resource
            if (transferSize > 0) {
                downloadedResources.set(url, transferSize);
                updateProgressDisplay();
            }
        }
    });
});

observer.observe({ entryTypes: ['resource'] });
```

This approach provides a more accurate and transparent loading experience for users while simplifying the implementation and maintenance of the loading progress system.
