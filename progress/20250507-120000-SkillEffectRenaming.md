# Skill Effect Renaming Implementation

## Overview
Renamed skill effect classes to match exactly with the skill names instead of using generic effect types. This improves code readability and makes the relationship between skills and their effects more explicit.

## Changes Made

### Created New Skill Effect Classes:
1. `WaveStrikeEffect.js` (replacing `RangedSkillEffect.js`)
2. `CycloneStrikeEffect.js` (replacing `AoESkillEffect.js`)
3. `SevenSidedStrikeEffect.js` (replacing `MultiSkillEffect.js`)
4. `InnerSanctuaryEffect.js` (replacing `BuffSkillEffect.js`)
5. `MysticAllyEffect.js` (replacing `SummonSkillEffect.js`)
6. `WaveOfLightEffect.js` (replacing `WaveSkillEffect.js`)
7. `ExplodingPalmEffect.js` (replacing `MarkSkillEffect.js`)
8. `FistOfThunderEffect.js` (replacing `TeleportSkillEffect.js`)

### Updated Factory Class:
- Modified `SkillEffectFactory.js` to use the new class names
- Changed the switch statement to use skill names instead of skill types
- Updated imports to reference the new class files

## Benefits
- More intuitive code organization with class names that directly match skill names
- Easier to understand the relationship between skills and their effects
- Better maintainability as each skill now has its own dedicated effect class
- Improved code readability for developers working on the project

## Next Steps
- The original effect files can be removed once all references to them have been updated
- Consider adding more specialized visual effects to each skill's effect class to make them more distinctive
- Update any documentation to reflect the new class naming convention
