# PWA Implementation for Monk Journey

## Summary
Successfully converted the Monk Journey game into a Progressive Web App (PWA) by implementing the following components:

1. **manifest.json** - Created a web app manifest file with:
   - App name and description
   - Display mode (standalone)
   - Theme colors
   - Icon definitions for different sizes

2. **service-worker.js** - Implemented a service worker that:
   - Caches essential game assets for offline use
   - Handles fetch events to serve cached content when offline
   - Manages cache versioning and updates

3. **Logo Images** - Used the logo-generator.html tool to create:
   - 192x192 pixel logo with the ðŸ§˜ emoji
   - 512x512 pixel logo with the ðŸ§˜ emoji

4. **index.html Updates** - Modified the main HTML file to include:
   - PWA meta tags
   - Manifest link
   - Apple touch icon
   - Service worker registration script

## Implementation Details

### Web App Manifest
Created a standard manifest.json file with proper configuration for PWA installation.

### Service Worker
Implemented a comprehensive service worker that:
- Caches key game assets during installation
- Serves cached content when offline
- Manages cache versions for updates
- Uses a cache-first strategy for optimal performance

### PWA Meta Tags
Added necessary meta tags to index.html for proper PWA behavior:
- Theme color
- Description
- Icons for various platforms

### Logo Generation
Used HTML5 Canvas to generate app icons featuring the ðŸ§˜ emoji on a black background.

## Testing
The PWA can be tested by:
1. Opening the game in a modern browser
2. Using browser developer tools to verify service worker registration
3. Testing offline functionality
4. Adding to home screen on mobile devices

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing additional offline features
- Add push notifications for game events
- Optimize asset caching for better performance
