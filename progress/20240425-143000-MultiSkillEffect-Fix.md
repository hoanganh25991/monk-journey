# MultiSkillEffect Bug Fix

## Issue
The Seven-Sided Strike skill was causing an error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')
    at MultiSkillEffect.update (MultiSkillEffect.js:152:36)
    at Skill.update (Skill.js:139:32)
    at PlayerSkills.updateSkills (PlayerSkills.js:146:23)
    at Player.update (Player.js:93:21)
    at Game.animate (Game.js:304:21)
    at Game.js:281:42
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the `MultiSkillEffect` class was trying to access `this.direction.x` in its update method, but the `direction` property was not being properly initialized or stored when the effect was created.

## Changes Made

1. Added initialization of the `direction` property in the constructor:
```javascript
constructor(skill) {
    super(skill);
    this.multiState = null;
    this.direction = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 1); // Default forward direction
}
```

2. Modified the `create` method to store the direction vector:
```javascript
create(position, direction) {
    // Create a group for the effect
    const effectGroup = new THREE.Group();
    
    // Store the direction vector
    this.direction = direction.clone();
    
    // Create the multi-hit effect
    this._createMultiHitEffect(effectGroup, position, direction);
    
    // Position effect
    effectGroup.position.copy(position);
    
    // Store effect
    this.effect = effectGroup;
    this.isActive = true;
    
    return effectGroup;
}
```

3. Added a safety check in the `update` method to ensure a valid direction vector:
```javascript
update(delta) {
    if (!this.isActive || !this.effect || !this.multiState) return;
    
    // Ensure we have a valid direction vector
    if (!this.direction) {
        // Create a default forward direction if missing
        this.direction = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 1);
    }
    
    // Rest of the update method...
}
```

## Result
The Seven-Sided Strike skill should now function correctly without throwing errors. The changes ensure that the `direction` property is always available and properly initialized, preventing the "Cannot read properties of undefined" error.
