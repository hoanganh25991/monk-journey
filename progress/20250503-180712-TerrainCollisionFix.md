# Terrain Collision Fix Implementation

## Problem
Players and enemies were still passing through terrain in some areas where the terrain was higher than their current position. The previous fix only addressed part of the issue, as it only adjusted the height during movement but not continuously.

## Solution
The solution involved implementing continuous terrain height checks for both players and enemies:

1. **Added Continuous Terrain Height Checks**:
   - Created a new `updateTerrainHeight` method for both Player and Enemy classes
   - This method continuously checks if the character is at the correct height relative to the terrain
   - If the character is below the terrain or too far above it, their position is adjusted

2. **Enhanced Player Update Cycle**:
   - Added the terrain height check to the player's update cycle
   - This ensures the player is always at the correct height, even when not actively moving

3. **Enhanced Enemy Update Cycle**:
   - Added the terrain height check to the enemy's update cycle
   - This ensures enemies are always at the correct height, even when not actively moving

## Implementation Details

### Player Terrain Height Check
```javascript
updateTerrainHeight() {
    // Ensure player is always at the correct terrain height
    if (this.game && this.game.world) {
        const terrainHeight = this.game.world.getTerrainHeight(this.position.x, this.position.z);
        
        // Only update if the terrain height is higher than current position
        // or if the player is significantly above the terrain
        if (this.position.y < terrainHeight + this.heightOffset || 
            this.position.y > terrainHeight + this.heightOffset + 0.5) {
            this.position.y = terrainHeight + this.heightOffset;
            
            // Update model position
            if (this.modelGroup) {
                this.modelGroup.position.y = this.position.y;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Enemy Terrain Height Check
```javascript
updateTerrainHeight() {
    // Ensure enemy is always at the correct terrain height
    if (this.world) {
        const terrainHeight = this.world.getTerrainHeight(this.position.x, this.position.z);
        
        // Only update if the terrain height is higher than current position
        // or if the enemy is significantly above the terrain
        if (this.position.y < terrainHeight + this.heightOffset || 
            this.position.y > terrainHeight + this.heightOffset + 0.5) {
            this.position.y = terrainHeight + this.heightOffset;
            
            // Update model position
            if (this.modelGroup) {
                this.modelGroup.position.y = this.position.y;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Results
With these changes, both players and enemies now properly follow the terrain surface at all times. They no longer clip through the terrain when it rises above their current position, and they don't float unrealistically high above the terrain. This creates a more realistic and immersive gameplay experience.
