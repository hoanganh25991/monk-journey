# Monk Character Model Enhancement

## Overview
This document summarizes the enhancements made to the monk character model in the Diablo Immortal project. The implementation follows the detailed requirements specified in the functional requirements document.

## Changes Made

### 1. Head and Face
- Replaced the simple sphere with a more detailed head using higher polygon count (32 segments)
- Added realistic eyes with separate white sclera and black pupils
- Created a serene expression with a subtle smile using a torus geometry
- Applied natural skin tone color (0xF5CBA7)

### 2. Torso
- Implemented a more anatomically correct torso with separate chest and abdomen
- Added muscle definition through geometry sizing and positioning
- Applied proper material properties (roughness and metalness) for skin

### 3. Arms
- Created more realistic arm structure with separate upper arms and forearms
- Implemented proper joint angles for a natural pose
- Added detailed hands with proper proportions
- Applied consistent skin tone across body parts

### 4. Legs

- Used dark gray color (0x2C3E50) for pants/leggings
- Added detailed feet with proper positioning

### 5. Monk-Specific Elements
- Created a detailed monk robe with proper draping using cylinder geometry
- Added a shawl/upper robe section in a slightly different color
- Implemented a detailed belt with knot and hanging ends
- Used appropriate colors: yellow/orange (0xF1C40F) for the robe and dark brown (0x553311) for the belt

### 6. Accessories
- Added prayer beads necklace with 12 wooden beads in a circular arrangement
- Created wrist beads (mala) for the left wrist
- Added simple wooden sandals

## Technical Improvements
- Increased polygon count for smoother appearance
- Applied proper material properties (roughness, metalness) for different surfaces
- Improved shadow casting for all model parts
- Organized code with clear section comments
- Maintained proper scene hierarchy for animations

## Result
The enhanced monk character model now closely resembles the Diablo Immortal aesthetic with:
- A serene, disciplined appearance
- Traditional monk attire with proper coloring
- Religious/spiritual accessories
- Anatomically correct proportions
- Detailed facial features

The model maintains good performance while significantly improving visual quality.
