# Initial Loading Indicator HTML/CSS Implementation

## Summary
Converted the JavaScript-based initial loading indicator to an HTML and CSS implementation. This approach provides better performance and maintainability by separating the structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript).

## Changes Made

1. Created a new CSS file `initial-loading.css` with styles for the loading indicator
2. Added the CSS file import to `main.css`
3. Added HTML structure for the loading indicator in `index.html`
4. Updated `initial-load-progress.js` to work with the new HTML structure:
   - Removed dynamic element creation
   - Added function to get references to existing HTML elements
   - Updated initialization to work with the DOM ready state

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for behavior
- **Performance**: Reduced JavaScript execution during initial loading
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update styles in CSS file
- **Consistency**: Follows the same pattern as the rest of the application

## Implementation Details

### HTML Structure
```html
<div id="initial-loading-indicator">
    <h2 class="loading-title">Loading Monk Journey...</h2>
    <div class="loading-bar-container">
        <div class="loading-bar"></div>
    </div>
    <p class="loading-text">Loading resources...</p>
    <p class="loading-info">Downloading game assets...</p>
</div>
```

### CSS Styling
Created a dedicated CSS file with styles for:
- Loading container
- Loading title
- Progress bar container and bar
- Loading text and info elements

### JavaScript Updates
Modified the JavaScript to:
- Get references to existing HTML elements instead of creating them
- Initialize when the DOM is ready
- Update the progress bar and text elements as before

The loading indicator will still automatically hide when the game's loading screen appears or after 30 seconds as a safety measure.
