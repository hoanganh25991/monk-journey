# Loading Progress Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the initial loading progress system to better utilize the file-sizes.json data for more accurate and informative progress reporting. The improvements provide users with detailed category-based progress information during the game's initial loading phase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Category-Based Progress Tracking
- Added detailed tracking of file loading progress by category
- Implemented a system to calculate and display per-category loading percentages
- Added real-time reporting of which category is currently most actively loading

### 2. Improved Progress Display
- Enhanced the progress messages to show more detailed information:
  - Overall progress percentage
  - Total loaded bytes vs. total expected bytes
  - Current category being loaded with its individual progress percentage
  - File currently being loaded

### 3. Better Completion Statistics
- Added detailed completion statistics at the end of loading
- Enhanced the completion event with category-based loading information
- Improved console logging with per-category statistics

### 4. Fallback Improvements
- Added better fallback information when PerformanceObserver is not available
- Improved initial loading screen with category information from file-sizes.json

## Technical Implementation Details

### Category Tracking System
The implementation now maintains a `fileCategories` array that tracks:
- Total size of files in each category
- Currently loaded size for each category
- Loading percentage for each category

### Enhanced File Information
The system now extracts more detailed information from file-sizes.json:
- Expected file size for each resource
- Proper categorization of files
- Comparison between expected and actual download sizes

### Performance Observer Enhancements
- Added category progress updates to the PerformanceObserver callback
- Improved logging with size accuracy information (comparing actual vs. expected sizes)

## Benefits
1. **More Accurate Progress Reporting**: Users see realistic progress based on actual file sizes
2. **Better User Experience**: More detailed information during loading reduces perceived wait time
3. **Improved Debugging**: Enhanced logging makes it easier to identify loading issues
4. **Category-Based Insights**: Developers can see which asset categories take longest to load

## Future Improvements
Potential future enhancements could include:
- Priority-based loading for critical assets
- Preloading of essential categories before others
- More detailed visualization of category-based loading progress
- Adaptive loading based on network conditions
