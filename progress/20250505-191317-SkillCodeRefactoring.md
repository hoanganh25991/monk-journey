# Skill Code Refactoring

## Task Description
Refactored the skill effect code structure by moving the monolithic implementation from `js/entities/Skill.js.bak` to the `js/entities/skills` directory.

## Changes Made
1. Copied the entire content of `js/entities/Skill.js.bak` to `js/entities/skills/Skill.js`
2. Updated `js/entities/skills/index.js` to only export the `Skill` class
3. Preserved the original implementation while maintaining the new directory structure

## Technical Details
- The original implementation contained all skill effect logic in a single file
- The refactored structure keeps the same functionality but organizes it in the skills directory
- All skill effect types (ranged, AoE, multi, etc.) are maintained in the same file as in the original implementation

## Benefits
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- Preserves the exact behavior of skill effects
- Organizes code in a more structured directory

## Next Steps
- Consider removing unused files if they're no longer needed
- Update any imports in other files that might be referencing the old location
