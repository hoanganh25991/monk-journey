# Notification System Enhancement

## Problem
The notification system was experiencing issues where too many messages would cause screen flooding. This created a poor user experience when multiple notifications were triggered in rapid succession.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive enhancement to the notification system with the following improvements:

1. **Asynchronous Message Queue**
   - Added a message queue system to decouple message creation from display
   - Messages are now added to a queue and processed at regular intervals
   - Implemented a maximum queue size with intelligent dropping of old messages

2. **Improved Max Size Management**
   - Enhanced the maximum visible notification limit based on screen size
   - Added aggressive cleanup when messages are added too quickly
   - Implemented dynamic scaling of notifications based on message volume

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Added null checks throughout the code to prevent errors with missing elements
   - Improved error handling in the message processing pipeline
   - Added a clearAllNotifications method for emergency cleanup

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Reduced DOM operations by batching notification updates
   - Improved message deduplication to prevent redundant notifications
   - Added dynamic lifetime adjustment based on message frequency

## Implementation Details

### Message Queue System
- Added a message queue with configurable size limit
- Implemented a queue processor that runs at regular intervals
- Messages are now popped from the queue instead of being displayed synchronously

### Dynamic Notification Management
- Added message rate detection to adjust notification behavior
- Implemented aggressive cleanup when message rate exceeds thresholds
- Added compression of notifications to fit in available screen space

### Error Prevention
- Added null checks throughout the code
- Improved handling of edge cases like rapid message addition
- Added safeguards against DOM manipulation errors

## Benefits
- Smoother notification experience even with high message volumes
- Reduced screen clutter during intense gameplay moments
- More consistent and reliable notification display
- Better performance with large numbers of notifications

## Files Changed
- `/js/core/hud-manager/NotificationsUI.js`
