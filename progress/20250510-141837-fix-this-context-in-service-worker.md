# Fix 'this' Context in Service Worker Registration

## Issue
The service worker registration code in `registration.js` had several instances of `const self = this` that were used to preserve the `this` context in callback functions. This approach is redundant when using arrow functions, which automatically preserve the lexical `this` context.

## Changes Made
1. Removed unnecessary `const self = this` declarations where arrow functions were used
2. For the message channel event handler, replaced `const self = this` with `const instance = this` and added a comment explaining why it's necessary (since the event handler's `this` context is different)
3. Updated all callback functions to use the appropriate reference to the class instance

### Specific Changes:
1. In the `handleStateChange` method:
   - Removed `const self = this` and `const selfRef = this`
   - Updated setTimeout callbacks to use `this` directly

2. In the `initialize` method:
   - Removed `const self = this` declaration

3. In the `createMessageChannel` method:
   - Replaced `const self = this` with `const instance = this`
   - Added a comment explaining why this variable is necessary
   - Updated the event handler to use `instance` instead of `self`

## Benefits
1. Cleaner, more modern JavaScript code
2. Better use of arrow function features (lexical `this` binding)
3. More consistent code style
4. Improved readability with appropriate comments where needed

## Technical Explanation
When using arrow functions (`() => {}`), the `this` value is lexically bound - it's automatically inherited from the surrounding code. This means we don't need to manually store `this` in a variable like `self` when using arrow functions.

However, in event handlers like the message channel's `onmessage`, the `this` context can change, so we still need to store a reference to the class instance (using `const instance = this`) to ensure we can access class methods from within the callback.
