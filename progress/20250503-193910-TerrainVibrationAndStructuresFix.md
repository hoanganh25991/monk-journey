# Terrain Vibration and Structures Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Terrain Vibration Issue**
   - Fixed the terrain vibration issue by ensuring consistent terrain height (always exactly 0)
   - Modified the player's updateTerrainHeight method to use a smaller smoothing factor (0.05)
   - Added a check for initialTerrainCreated to prevent vibration during initial loading
   - Ensured all terrain chunks are positioned at exactly y=0

2. **Structures Not Appearing When Moving Far Away**
   - Increased structure density for houses, towers, ruins, and dark sanctums
   - Modified updateVisibleChunks to ensure structures are generated for each chunk
   - Modified updateTerrainChunks to always check and generate structures if needed
   - Added code to convert between small chunks and terrain chunks for structure generation

3. **Enhanced Structure Variety**
   - Added a new createTower method with randomized properties:
     - Variable height (10-25 units)
     - Variable radius (2-5 units)
     - Random number of windows and segments
     - Optional flag at the top with random color
   - Enhanced the createDarkSanctum method with:
     - Randomized base size and pillar height
     - Improved positioning of pillars based on base size
     - Added optional decorative elements (skulls)

## Implementation Details

1. **Terrain Height Consistency**
   - Modified getTerrainHeight to always return exactly 0
   - Ensured all terrain chunks are positioned at exactly y=0
   - Added comments to highlight the importance of consistent terrain height

2. **Structure Generation**
   - Doubled the density of houses (0.001)
   - Increased tower density (0.0008)
   - Doubled ruins density (0.0008)
   - Doubled dark sanctum density while keeping it rare (0.0002)
   - Added code to track placed structures by chunk key
   - Added special structure tracking for landmarks

3. **Player Movement**
   - Improved the player's terrain height adjustment with a smaller smoothing factor
   - Added a check for initialTerrainCreated to prevent vibration during initial loading

## Future Improvements

1. **Structure Variety**
   - Add more structure types (camps, shrines, etc.)
   - Implement structure-specific interactions

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement level-of-detail (LOD) for distant structures
   - Add object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects

3. **Terrain Features**
   - Add subtle height variations while maintaining stability
   - Implement different biomes with unique structure types
