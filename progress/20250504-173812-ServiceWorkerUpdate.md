# Service Worker Update Mechanism

## Issue Analysis
The user wanted to know if the service worker automatically updates when new files are added to the project.

## Current Implementation
- The service worker uses a static list of assets to cache in the `ASSETS_TO_CACHE` array
- Cache versioning is managed through the `CACHE_NAME` constant
- New files are not automatically added to the cache unless explicitly listed

## Solution Implemented
1. Modified the service worker to use a more explicit versioning system:
   - Added a separate `CACHE_VERSION` constant
   - Updated the cache name to use this version number
   - Added a comment to remind the developer to update the version when adding new files

## How to Update When Adding New Files
When adding new files to the project:
1. Add the file paths to the `ASSETS_TO_CACHE` array in service-worker.js
2. Increment the `CACHE_VERSION` number
3. Deploy the updated service-worker.js

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
For a more automated approach, consider:
1. Creating a build script that automatically scans directories (js, assets, css, images) and generates the asset list
2. Implementing a hash-based caching strategy where the cache name is based on the content hash
3. Using a service worker library like Workbox that provides more advanced caching strategies

## Completion Status
✅ Service worker versioning mechanism improved
✅ Documentation added for how to update when adding new files
