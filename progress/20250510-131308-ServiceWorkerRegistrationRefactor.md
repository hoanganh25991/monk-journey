# Service Worker Registration Refactoring

## Task Summary
Refactored the service worker registration script (`pwa/registration.js`) from a functional approach to a class-based approach while maintaining the self-invoking pattern for direct inclusion in HTML.

## Changes Made
1. Converted the script from a collection of functions to a proper ES6 class named `ServiceWorkerRegistration`
2. Maintained the self-invoking pattern by wrapping the class in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
3. Added proper JSDoc comments for better code documentation
4. Improved code organization by:
   - Moving all functions to class methods
   - Using proper `this` binding for method calls
   - Using `const self = this` pattern for callbacks to maintain context
5. Preserved all original functionality while making the code more maintainable

## Benefits
1. **Better Organization**: Code is now organized in a more logical, object-oriented structure
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Class-based approach makes it easier to extend and maintain
3. **Better Documentation**: Added JSDoc comments for better code understanding
4. **Same Usage Pattern**: Still works exactly the same way when included in HTML

## Implementation Details
- The class is instantiated immediately within the IIFE to maintain the same behavior
- All DOM manipulation and service worker registration logic remains unchanged
- The script still performs the same environment checks before proceeding with registration

## Testing
The refactored code should be tested to ensure:
1. Service worker registration works correctly
2. Update notifications display properly
3. Progress indicators function as expected
4. All error handling remains intact

## Next Steps
Consider further improvements:
1. Add more configuration options to make the class more flexible
2. Implement a public API for external control if needed
3. Add unit tests for better reliability
