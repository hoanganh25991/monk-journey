# Remove Unnecessary Page Reloads from Service Worker Registration

## Issue
The game was experiencing multiple screen flashes during initial loading because the service worker registration process was causing unnecessary page reloads that interrupted the file-tracker.js progress tracking.

## Analysis
The service worker registration code in `registration.js` contained logic to reload the page in two scenarios:
1. When the service worker controller changed (`controllerchange` event)
2. When a service worker was installed and there was an existing controller

These reloads were unnecessary because:
- Service workers operate at the network level, intercepting and caching requests
- Once a service worker is registered and activated, it will automatically handle requests without requiring a page reload
- The reloads were interrupting the game's loading process tracked by file-tracker.js

## Solution
Completely removed all page reload logic from the service worker registration process:

1. Removed the `window.location.reload()` call from the `controllerchange` event handler
2. Removed the conditional reload logic from the service worker 'installed' state handler

### Changes Made
1. Updated the `controllerchange` event handler to log the change but not reload the page
2. Simplified the service worker 'installed' state handler to update the UI without reloading

## Why Reloads Were Unnecessary
Service workers are designed to work without requiring page reloads:

1. **Network Interception**: Service workers act as a proxy between the web app and the network, intercepting requests at the network level
2. **Transparent Caching**: Once activated, a service worker automatically serves cached resources for subsequent requests
3. **Background Operation**: Service workers operate in the background, independent of the page lifecycle
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Service workers are meant to enhance the experience without disrupting it

The only time a reload might be necessary is when you want to immediately apply new assets from an updated service worker, but even then, it's better to let the user control when to refresh rather than forcing it.

## Benefits
1. Eliminates the screen flashes during initial loading
2. Allows file-tracker.js to complete its progress tracking without interruption
3. Maintains the service worker functionality for offline and fast loading on subsequent visits
4. Improves the user experience by providing a smooth, uninterrupted loading process
5. Simplifies the code by removing unnecessary complexity

## Testing
The changes should be tested by:
1. Loading the game for the first time in a fresh browser (or after clearing cache)
2. Verifying that the loading progress completes without interruption
3. Reloading the page manually to verify that the service worker is still functioning correctly
