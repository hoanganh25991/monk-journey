# Terrain Fixes - April 25, 2024

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Vibrating Initial Terrain
The initial terrain was vibrating compared to the terrain chunks generated later. This was caused by inconsistencies between the initial terrain and the dynamically generated terrain chunks.

**Solution:**
- Modified the terrain size from 100 to 50 to match the terrain chunk size
- Reduced the terrain resolution from 128 to 16 to match the terrain chunks
- This ensures consistent appearance and behavior between the initial terrain and dynamically generated terrain chunks

### 2. Water Removal
The water plane was no longer needed as it had been replaced with grass terrain.

**Solution:**
- Removed the call to `createWater()` in the `createTerrain()` method
- Replaced the `createWater()` method with a comment indicating it's been removed
- Updated the `clearWorldObjects()` method to properly handle terrain cleanup

## Changes Made

1. Modified terrain parameters in the constructor to match terrain chunks:
   - `terrainSize`: 100 → 50
   - `terrainResolution`: 128 → 16

2. Removed water creation:
   - Removed the call to `createWater()` in `createTerrain()`
   - Replaced the `createWater()` method with a comment

3. Enhanced cleanup in `clearWorldObjects()`:
   - Added code to properly remove and dispose of the initial terrain

## Results

- The initial terrain now matches the dynamically generated terrain chunks, eliminating the vibration effect
- The water plane has been completely removed, leaving only the grass terrain
- The game world now has a consistent appearance throughout
