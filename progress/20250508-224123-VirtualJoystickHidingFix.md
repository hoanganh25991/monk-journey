# Virtual Joystick Hiding Fix

## Overview

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed HUDManager.js
- Updated the `hideAllUI()` method to target the correct joystick element ID (`virtual-joystick-container`)
- Updated the `showAllUI()` method to properly show the joystick when returning to the game
- Added fallback checks for both old and new joystick element IDs

### 2. Fixed SettingsMenu.js
- Updated the `hideHUDElements()` method to target the correct joystick element ID
