# Player Initialization Fix

## Issue
After refactoring the Player class, an error occurred during game initialization:
```
Error initializing game: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'setGame')
    at Player.setGame (Player.js:57:23)
    at Game.init (Game.js:103:21)
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a timing issue in the initialization sequence:

1. In Game.js, `setGame()` was called on the Player instance before `init()`
2. In the refactored Player class, the components (movement, skills, combat) were initialized in the `init()` method
3. When `setGame()` was called, these components were still null, causing the error

## Solution
The solution involved several changes to handle the initialization sequence properly:

1. Modified the `setGame()` method in Player.js to check if components are initialized before trying to use them:
   ```javascript
   setGame(game) {
       this.game = game;
       
       // If components are already initialized, pass game reference to them
       if (this.movement && this.skills && this.combat) {
           this.movement.setGame(game);
           this.skills.setGame(game);
           this.combat.setGame(game);
       }
       // Otherwise, the game reference will be passed to components in init()
   }
   ```

2. Updated the `init()` method to pass the game reference to components after they're initialized:
   ```javascript
   // If game reference was set before initialization, pass it to components now
   if (this.game) {
       this.movement.setGame(this.game);
       this.skills.setGame(this.game);
       this.combat.setGame(this.game);
   }
   ```

3. Modified Game.js to call `setGame()` again after `init()` to ensure all components have the game reference:
   ```javascript
   // Initialize player
   this.player = new Player(this.scene, this.camera, this.loadingManager);
   this.player.setGame(this);
   await this.player.init();
   
   // Ensure game reference is set after initialization
   this.player.setGame(this);
   ```

## Benefits
1. **Robust Initialization**: The Player class now handles initialization in any order
2. **Defensive Programming**: Added null checks to prevent similar errors
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between object creation and initialization

## Future Improvements
1. Consider using a dependency injection framework to manage object lifecycles
2. Implement a more formal initialization sequence with clear stages
3. Add more comprehensive error handling during initialization
