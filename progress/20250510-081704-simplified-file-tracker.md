# Simplified File Tracker Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a streamlined file tracking system that focuses exclusively on monitoring files listed in file-sizes.json. The system integrates with the existing loading UI in index.html to provide real-time progress information about downloaded and cached files.

## Key Features

### Focused File Tracking
- Tracks only files listed in file-sizes.json
- Distinguishes between downloaded and cached files
- Provides both file count and size-based progress metrics

### UI Integration
- Uses the existing loading indicator in index.html
- Updates the loading bar based on file count percentage
- Shows detailed information about downloaded vs. cached files
- Displays both file count and size-based progress

### Immediate Observation
- Starts tracking as soon as the page begins loading
- Works even before file-sizes.json is loaded
- Recalculates progress once file-sizes.json becomes available

### Completion Summary
- Shows a summary when loading is complete
- Displays total files loaded (e.g., 115/156 files)
- Breaks down downloaded vs. cached files
- Reports total loading time

## Implementation Details

### File Tracking Logic
- Uses PerformanceObserver to monitor network requests
- Identifies files from file-sizes.json by filename
- Determines if files are downloaded or loaded from cache based on transferSize
- Calculates progress based on both file count and actual file sizes

### UI Updates
- Updates the loading bar width based on file count percentage
- Shows file count in the loading text (e.g., "Loading resources... 75% (115/156 files)")
- Displays detailed breakdown in the info text (e.g., "Downloaded: 30, Cached: 85 - Size: 8.5MB/9.93MB (85%)")
- Updates the loading title with current percentage

### Completion Detection
- Considers loading complete when 95% or more files are loaded
- Waits for document.readyState to be 'complete'
- Shows a final summary with loading time and file statistics
- Dispatches a custom event for other scripts to detect completion

## Benefits

- **Simplified Implementation**: Focused solely on tracking files from file-sizes.json
- **Integrated UI**: Uses existing loading indicator instead of creating new elements
- **Accurate Reporting**: Distinguishes between downloaded and cached files
- **Dual Progress Metrics**: Shows both file count and size-based progress
- **Minimal Changes**: Requires only replacing the initial-load-progress.js script

This implementation provides users with clear visibility into the loading process, showing exactly how many files have been loaded compared to the total expected files from file-sizes.json.
