# Alternative Keyboard Controls Implementation

## Overview
Implemented alternative keyboard controls to allow players to use more ergonomic key combinations for skills:
- "j","k","l",";" keys now function as alternatives to "1","2","3","4" 
- "u","i","o" keys now function as alternatives to "5","6","7"

## Implementation Details

### 1. Added Key Mappings
Created a mapping system in the InputHandler class to associate alternative keys with their corresponding digit keys:
```javascript
this.keyMapping = {
    KeyJ: 'Digit1',
    KeyK: 'Digit2',
    KeyL: 'Digit3',
    Semicolon: 'Digit4',
    KeyU: 'Digit5',
    KeyI: 'Digit6',
    KeyO: 'Digit7'
};
```

### 2. Updated Key Tracking
Extended the skill key tracking objects to include the alternative keys:
- Added alternative keys to `skillKeysHeld` object
- Added alternative keys to `skillCastCooldowns` object

### 3. Enhanced Event Handlers
- Updated the keydown event handler to recognize alternative keys and map them to their corresponding digit keys
- Updated the keyup event handler to properly reset both alternative and original keys
- Modified the update method to handle continuous casting for alternative keys

### 4. Synchronized Key States
Ensured that when an alternative key is pressed or released, the corresponding original key's state is also updated for consistency.

## Benefits
- More ergonomic keyboard layout for players who prefer to keep their left hand in a more natural typing position
- Provides alternative options for players with different keyboard layouts or preferences
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding new control options

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Alternative keys correctly trigger the same skills as their corresponding digit keys
- Continuous casting works properly when holding alternative keys
- Key state synchronization works correctly between alternative and original keys
