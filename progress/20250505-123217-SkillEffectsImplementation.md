# Skill Effects Implementation

## Overview
This update implements the missing skill effect types that were referenced in the Skill.js file but were not properly integrated into the SkillEffectFactory. The implementation ensures that all skill types now have dedicated effect classes.

## Changes Made

### Added New Effect Classes
1. **BuffSkillEffect.js**
   - Implements visual effects for buff-type skills
   - Creates orbiting particles and auras around the player
   - Includes pulsing animations and dynamic color effects

2. **WaveSkillEffect.js**
   - Implements wave-based attack visuals
   - Creates forward-moving wave effects with energy rings
   - Includes particle systems and trailing effects

3. **SummonSkillEffect.js**
   - Implements summoning portal and entity emergence
   - Creates multi-stage animation (portal opening, entity emerging, completion)
   - Includes runes, energy beams, and particle effects

4. **MarkSkillEffect.js**
   - Implements target marking/debuff visuals
   - Creates ground-based rune circles with orbiting elements
   - Includes target tracking functionality

### Updated Factory and Exports
1. **SkillEffectFactory.js**
   - Added support for all new effect types in the switch statement
   - Imported all new effect classes

2. **index.js**
   - Updated exports to include all new effect classes

## Technical Details
- All effect classes extend the base SkillEffect class
- Each effect implements custom create() and update() methods
- Animations are time-based for consistent performance
- Effects include proper cleanup and disposal methods

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with various skill configurations and works as expected. The visual effects are consistent with the game's art style and provide clear feedback to the player about skill usage.

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more specialized effects for specific named skills
- Optimize particle counts for better performance on mobile devices
- Add sound integration for enhanced feedback
