# Skills Configuration Refactoring

## Summary
Successfully refactored the player skills system to use a centralized configuration file. This improves code maintainability and makes it easier to modify skill properties in a single location.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new `config/index.js` file with the SKILLS configuration as a plain JSON array
2. Updated `PlayerSkills.js` to:
   - Import the SKILLS configuration from config/index.js
   - Use the configuration in the `initializeSkills()` method
   - Refactor skill instance creation to use the configuration directly

## Benefits

- Centralized skill configuration in a single file
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier to maintain and update skill properties
- More consistent skill creation across the codebase

## Files Modified

- Created: `/Users/anhle/work-station/diablo-immortal/js/config/index.js`
- Modified: `/Users/anhle/work-station/diablo-immortal/js/entities/player/PlayerSkills.js`

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more game configurations to the config/index.js file
- Implement validation for skill configurations
- Add documentation for the skill configuration format
