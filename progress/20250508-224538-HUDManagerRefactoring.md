# HUD Manager Refactoring

## Overview
Refactored the HUD management code to centralize UI visibility control in the HUDManager class, removing redundant code from GameMenu and SettingsMenu classes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced HUDManager.js
- Improved the `hideAllUI()` method to comprehensively hide all UI elements
- Improved the `showAllUI()` method to comprehensively show all UI elements
- Organized UI elements into logical groups (player-related, skill-related, enemy-related, control-related)
- Added explicit handling for all known UI elements

### 2. Simplified GameMenu.js
- Removed the redundant `hideHUDElements()` method
- Modified the `show()` method to use HUDManager's `hideAllUI()` method directly

### 3. Simplified SettingsMenu.js
- Removed the redundant `hideHUDElements()` method
- Modified the `show()` method to use HUDManager's `hideAllUI()` method directly

## Technical Details
- Centralized UI visibility control in the HUDManager class
- Ensured consistent handling of all UI elements
- Improved code maintainability by removing duplicate code
- Added comprehensive handling for all known UI elements

## Testing
- Verified that HUD elements are properly hidden when opening the Game menu
- Verified that HUD elements are properly hidden when opening the Settings menu
- Verified that HUD elements are properly shown when starting a new game
- Verified that HUD elements are properly shown when loading a saved game
