# Infinite Terrain Implementation

## Overview
This update implements a 10x larger terrain with infinite looping and random object placement. The terrain now wraps around seamlessly, allowing the player to explore endlessly in any direction. As the player moves, new objects are dynamically generated in the surrounding area, creating a constantly changing world.

## Changes Made

### World Size Increase
- Increased terrain size from 100 to 1000 units (10x larger)
- Increased terrain resolution from 128 to 256 for better detail
- Adjusted water plane size to match the larger terrain

### Infinite Terrain System
- Implemented coordinate wrapping in the `getTerrainHeight` method
- Added chunk-based object generation system
- Created a seeded random number generator for consistent chunk generation
- Added methods to track and update visible chunks as the player moves

### Dynamic Object Generation
- Added system to generate objects based on player position
- Implemented chunk-based object management (creation and removal)
- Added variety of randomly placed objects (ruins, buildings, trees, rocks, etc.)
- Ensured objects are properly positioned on the terrain

### Player Movement Updates
- Updated player movement to work with the infinite terrain
- Added terrain height calculation for proper player positioning
- Added world update calls based on player position

## Technical Details
- Chunk size: 200 units
- Render distance: 2 chunks in each direction
- Object density: 0.0001 objects per square unit
- Seeded random generation for consistent chunk content

## Future Improvements
- Add more variety to generated objects
- Implement biomes for different terrain types
- Add special landmarks that appear rarely
- Optimize object creation/removal for better performance
