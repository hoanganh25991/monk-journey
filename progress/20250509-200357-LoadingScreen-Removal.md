# LoadingScreen Removal from main.js

## Summary
Successfully removed the LoadingScreen implementation from main.js since it's already being handled by pwa/initial-load-progress.js. This eliminates duplicate loading screen instances and potential conflicts between the two implementations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed from main.js:
- Removed the import of LoadingScreen class
- Removed the creation and showing of the loading screen
- Removed the code that hides the loading screen after game initialization

### 2. Verification:
- Confirmed that pwa/initial-load-progress.js properly handles the loading screen functionality
- Verified that the LoadingScreen class implementation is complete and handles all necessary loading screen operations

## Technical Details

The LoadingScreen was being initialized in two places:
1. In main.js during game initialization
2. In pwa/initial-load-progress.js during initial page load

By removing the LoadingScreen from main.js, we ensure that only one instance of the loading screen is created and managed, which is handled by pwa/initial-load-progress.js. This prevents potential conflicts and improves the loading experience.

The pwa/initial-load-progress.js file:
- Creates and shows the loading screen
- Tracks loading progress
- Updates the loading screen with progress information
- Hides the loading screen when loading is complete or after a timeout

This change simplifies the codebase and ensures a more consistent loading experience for users.
