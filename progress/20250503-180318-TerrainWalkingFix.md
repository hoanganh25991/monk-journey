# Terrain Walking Fix Implementation

## Problem
Players and enemies were not properly walking on the terrain surface. Instead, they were moving through the terrain when it was higher than their current position.

## Solution
The solution involved making the following changes:

1. **Enemy Class Modifications**:
   - Added a `world` reference property to the Enemy class to access the terrain height
   - Modified the movement logic to get the terrain height at the new position
   - Adjusted the enemy's Y position to be at the terrain height plus a height offset

2. **EnemyManager Modifications**:
   - Updated the `spawnEnemy` method to set the world reference for each enemy
   - Updated the `spawnBoss` method to set the world reference for boss enemies
   - Adjusted the initial spawn position to be on the terrain surface

## Implementation Details

### Enemy Movement Logic
The key change was in the enemy movement code, where we now get the terrain height at each step:

```javascript
// Calculate new position
const newPosition = new THREE.Vector3(
    this.position.x + direction.x * step,
    this.position.y,
    this.position.z + direction.z * step
);

// Get terrain height at new position if world is available
if (this.world) {
    const terrainHeight = this.world.getTerrainHeight(newPosition.x, newPosition.z);
    newPosition.y = terrainHeight + this.heightOffset;
}

// Update position
this.setPosition(newPosition.x, newPosition.y, newPosition.z);
```

### Enemy Spawning
We also updated the enemy spawning logic to ensure enemies start at the correct height:

```javascript
// Set world reference for terrain height
if (this.game && this.game.world) {
    enemy.world = this.game.world;
    
    // Adjust initial position to be on terrain
    if (spawnPosition) {
        const terrainHeight = this.game.world.getTerrainHeight(spawnPosition.x, spawnPosition.z);
        spawnPosition.y = terrainHeight + enemy.heightOffset;
    }
}
```

## Results
With these changes, both players and enemies now properly follow the terrain surface as they move around the world. This creates a more realistic and immersive gameplay experience, as characters no longer clip through the terrain or float above it.
