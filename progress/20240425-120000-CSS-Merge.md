# CSS Merge Summary

## Task
Merged css/components.css and css/ui.css into a single file, with ui.css styles overriding components.css styles.

## Approach
1. Analyzed both CSS files to understand their structure and content
2. Created a new file (css/merged.css) that combines both files
3. Organized the merged file with components.css styles first, followed by ui.css styles
4. Ensured that duplicate selectors from ui.css would override those from components.css
5. Added clear section comments to indicate which styles came from which original file

## Result
Successfully created a merged CSS file that maintains all styles from both files while ensuring ui.css styles take precedence over components.css styles when there are conflicts.

## Files Modified
- Created: css/merged.css

## Next Steps
To use the merged CSS file:
1. Update HTML files to reference the new merged.css instead of the individual files
2. Test the application to ensure all styles are applied correctly
3. Consider minifying the merged CSS file for production use
