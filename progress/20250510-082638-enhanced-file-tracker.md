# Enhanced File Tracker Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the file tracking system to monitor all network requests, not just files listed in file-sizes.json. This update bridges the gap between Chrome's network panel statistics and the file tracker's reported numbers, providing a more accurate representation of loading progress.

## Key Changes

### Comprehensive Network Request Tracking
- Now tracks all network requests, not just files listed in file-sizes.json
- Maintains separate tracking for known files (from file-sizes.json) and all files
- Uses both transferSize and encodedBodySize to accurately measure downloaded and cached files
- Provides a more accurate representation of total download size

### Dual Progress Reporting
- Shows progress for both known files (from file-sizes.json) and all network requests
- Displays total file count, including files not listed in file-sizes.json
- Reports both downloaded and cached files for a complete picture
- Calculates percentages based on both file count and actual size

### Improved Progress Calculation
- Uses a weighted approach that considers both known files and total network activity
- Adjusts expected total size to account for files not listed in file-sizes.json
- Provides more accurate progress percentage that better matches Chrome's network panel
- Handles edge cases where more files are loaded than listed in file-sizes.json

### Enhanced API
- Exposes detailed statistics for both known files and all files
- Provides separate metrics for downloaded and cached files
- Includes both file count and size-based percentages
- Offers a more comprehensive data structure for integration with other components

## Implementation Details

### Tracking Variables
- Added separate tracking for known files (from file-sizes.json) and all network requests
- Maintains separate counters for downloaded and cached files in both categories
- Stores file sizes for files not listed in file-sizes.json

### Progress Calculation
- Uses a combination of known file progress and total network activity
- Adjusts expected total size by a factor of 1.2 to account for unlisted files
- Displays the higher percentage between known files and all files
- Caps progress at 95% until loading is complete

### Completion Detection
- Considers loading complete when any of these conditions are met:
  - 95% or more of known files are loaded
  - Total files loaded exceeds 120% of expected files
  - Document is complete and a minimum time has passed
- Provides a detailed summary of both known and all files when complete

## Benefits

- **More Accurate Progress**: Better matches what Chrome's network panel shows
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Captures all network activity, not just known files
- **Detailed Reporting**: Distinguishes between known files and all network requests
- **Better User Experience**: Provides more realistic loading progress indication

This enhancement addresses the gap between Chrome's network panel statistics and the file tracker's reported numbers, providing users with a more accurate representation of loading progress.
