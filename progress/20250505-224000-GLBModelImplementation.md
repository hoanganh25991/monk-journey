# GLB Model Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the player model system to use a 3D GLB model (warrior_monk.glb) while maintaining the original procedural model as a fallback. This provides a more detailed and realistic character representation while ensuring compatibility with existing code.

## Changes Made

### PlayerModel.js
1. Added GLTFLoader import from Three.js to load GLB models
2. Modified the `createModel` method to:
   - First attempt to load the warrior_monk.glb model
   - Fall back to the original procedural model if loading fails
   - Set up animation mixer for GLB animations

3. Enhanced the `updateAnimations` method to:
   - Handle GLB model animations when available
   - Maintain original procedural animations as fallback
   - Transition between different animation states (idle, walking, attacking)

4. Updated all punch animation methods to support both model types:
   - `createLeftPunchAnimation`
   - `createRightPunchAnimation`
   - `createLeftHookAnimation`
   - `createHeavyPunchAnimation`

5. Each animation method now:
   - Checks if using GLB model
   - Uses appropriate animation from the GLB if available
   - Falls back to procedural animation if needed
   - Creates appropriate visual effects for both model types

## Benefits
- More detailed and realistic character model
- Support for pre-made animations from the GLB file
- Graceful fallback to ensure compatibility
- Maintains all existing functionality

## Technical Details
- The GLB model is loaded from `/assets/models/warrior_monk.glb`
- Animation transitions use fade-in/fade-out for smooth blending
- Scale and positioning match the original model for consistent gameplay
- All punch effects and visual feedback are maintained

## Future Improvements
- Add more specialized animations for different skills
- Fine-tune animation timing and transitions
- Add support for more detailed character customization
