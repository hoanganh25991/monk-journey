# Raycaster Error Fix - Progress Report

## Issue Summary
Fixed an error in the InputHandler.js file where the Raycaster was trying to access the 'layers' property of undefined objects. The error occurred in the following stack trace:

```
three.module.js:50996 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'layers')
    at intersectObject (three.module.js:50996:14)
    at Raycaster.intersectObjects (three.module.js:50976:4)
    at InputHandler.updateMouseTarget (InputHandler.js:158:50)
    at InputHandler.js:107:18
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a mismatch between the code in InputHandler.js and the actual structure of the game world. The InputHandler was trying to access terrain and interactive objects directly from `this.game.world`, but the world structure had been refactored to use a manager-based approach with `WorldManager`, `TerrainManager`, and `InteractiveObjectManager`.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `updateMouseTarget()` method in InputHandler.js:
   - Added null checks for terrain and terrain chunks
   - Updated the path to access terrain objects through `this.game.world.terrainManager`
   - Added a check to ensure the terrainMeshes array is not empty before calling intersectObjects

2. Updated `checkInteraction()` method in InputHandler.js:
   - Added null checks for interactive objects
   - Updated the path to access interactive objects through `this.game.world.interactiveManager`
   - Added a check to ensure the interactiveObjects array is not empty before calling intersectObjects

3. Added helper methods to InteractiveObjectManager.js:
   - Added `getInteractiveObjects()` method to return all interactive objects
   - Added `getInteractiveObjectByMesh()` method to find an interactive object by its mesh

## Testing
The changes should fix the error by ensuring that the Raycaster only tries to intersect with valid objects. The code now properly handles the case where terrain or interactive objects might not be available yet.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any similar errors in other parts of the codebase
- Consider adding more robust error handling throughout the codebase
- Update any remaining code that might still be using the old world structure
