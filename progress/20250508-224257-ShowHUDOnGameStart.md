# Show HUD on Game Start

## Overview
Fixed an issue where HUD elements (hero portrait, joystick, skill buttons, etc.) were not being shown when starting a new game or loading a saved game.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced GameMenu.js
- Modified the New Game button click handler to explicitly show all HUD elements after starting the game
- Modified the Load Game button click handler to explicitly show all HUD elements after loading a saved game

### 2. Enhanced Game.js
- Modified the `start()` method to ensure all HUD elements are visible when the game starts
- Added an explicit call to `hudManager.showAllUI()` to make sure all UI elements are properly displayed

## Technical Details
- Used the existing `showAllUI()` method in HUDManager to ensure all HUD elements are properly shown
- Added the HUD display code after the game is started to ensure it takes precedence over any other UI state

## Testing
- Verified that HUD elements are properly shown when starting a new game
- Verified that HUD elements are properly shown when loading a saved game
- Verified that the virtual joystick and skill buttons are visible and functional after game start
