# World Save/Load Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds the ability to save and load the world state to local storage, including all dynamically generated terrain chunks, environment objects (trees, rocks, bushes, flowers), and other world data. This ensures that when a player saves and loads their game, the world will be restored exactly as it was, maintaining the persistent nature of the game world.

## Changes Made

### 1. World.js
- Added properties to store saved environment objects and terrain chunks
- Modified `createTerrainChunk` to check if a chunk was in the saved state
- Enhanced `generateEnvironmentObjects` to restore saved objects or generate new ones
- Added `clearWorldObjects` method to clean up the world state before loading
- Updated `updateWorldForPlayer` to clear temporary saved data after processing

### 2. SaveManager.js
- Enhanced `getWorldData` to serialize:
  - Environment objects (trees, rocks, bushes, flowers)
  - Terrain chunks
  - Current player chunk
  - Visible chunks and terrain chunks
- Improved `loadWorldData` to:
  - Restore environment objects
  - Restore terrain chunks
  - Update the world based on player position

## How It Works

### Saving Process
1. When the game is saved, the `SaveManager` collects all world data
2. Environment objects are serialized with their type and position
3. Terrain chunks are serialized (only their existence is stored)
4. All data is stored in local storage

### Loading Process
1. When the game is loaded, the `SaveManager` retrieves the saved world data
2. The world is cleared of existing objects
3. Saved data is stored temporarily in the World object
4. As the player moves around, chunks are regenerated based on the saved data
5. Environment objects are recreated at their saved positions

## Benefits
- Consistent world state between game sessions
- Persistent environment that players can recognize
- Memory-efficient storage (only storing necessary data)
- Seamless integration with the existing chunk-based world system

## Technical Notes
- Only the necessary data is saved (positions and types), not the full 3D objects
- Objects are recreated with the same visual properties when loaded
- The system handles both saved and newly generated chunks appropriately
