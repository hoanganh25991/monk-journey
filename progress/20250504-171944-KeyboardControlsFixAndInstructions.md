# Keyboard Controls Fix and Instructions

## Overview
Fixed issues with alternative keyboard controls, properly moved inventory toggle from "i" to "y" key, and added comprehensive keyboard control instructions in the options menu.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Alternative Key Handling
- Completely rewrote the keyboard event handling system to ensure all alternative keys work properly
- Moved key mapping definition to the top of the constructor for better organization
- Implemented a more robust default case in the switch statement to handle all alternative keys
- Added try-catch blocks to prevent errors during continuous casting

### 2. Properly Moved Inventory Toggle from "i" to "y"
- Removed the special case for "i" key that was causing conflicts
- Ensured "i" key is exclusively used as a skill key (mapped to Digit6)
- Confirmed "y" key properly toggles the inventory

### 3. Added Keyboard Controls Instructions
- Created a comprehensive keyboard controls section in the options menu
- Organized controls into logical categories:
  * Movement controls
  * Basic actions
  * Skills (both primary and alternative keys)
- Applied styling to make the instructions clear and easy to read
- Ensured the instructions accurately reflect the current key mappings

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks to prevent errors during continuous casting
- Added code to reset key states when errors occur to prevent cascading issues
- Enhanced logging to provide better diagnostic information

## Benefits
- More reliable keyboard controls for skills
- Clear separation between UI controls and skill controls
- Comprehensive documentation of controls accessible in-game
- Improved error handling for a more stable experience

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- All alternative keys correctly trigger their corresponding skills
- The "y" key properly toggles the inventory
- The "i" key works exclusively as a skill key
- Continuous casting works correctly when holding alternative keys
- The keyboard controls instructions are clear and accurate
