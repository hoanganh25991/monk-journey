# Three.js Material Error Fix

## Issue
The game was experiencing the following error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')
    at refreshUniformsCommon (three.module.js:13823:22)
    at Object.refreshMaterialUniforms (three.module.js:13735:4)
    at setProgram (three.module.js:17152:15)
    at WebGLRenderer.renderBufferDirect (three.module.js:15716:20)
```

This error occurs when Three.js tries to refresh material uniforms for an object that has been disposed or has invalid materials.

## Solution
The fix involved improving the material disposal and validation process in the Skill.js file:

1. Enhanced the `remove()` method to:
   - Properly check if materials exist before attempting to dispose them
   - Clear uniform values to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
   - Make objects invisible before removal to prevent rendering issues
   - Set userData to an empty object instead of null

2. Enhanced the `update()` method to:
   - Check if the effect is still valid (has a parent) before updating
   - Add a material validation function to detect invalid materials
   - Immediately remove effects with invalid materials
   - Improve error handling to force removal of problematic objects

## Benefits
- Prevents the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'value')" error
- Improves memory management by properly disposing of Three.js resources
- Makes the game more stable by preventing rendering of invalid objects
- Adds better error handling to gracefully recover from material-related issues

The game should now run without the material uniform errors while maintaining all functionality.
