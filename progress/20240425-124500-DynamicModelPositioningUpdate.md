# Dynamic Model Positioning Update

## Overview
This update improves the dynamic model adjustment system by removing hardcoded preview positions from the configuration files and implementing a fully dynamic approach to model positioning.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Preview Settings
- Removed the `preview` property from all model configurations in `player-models.js`
- Added comments to clarify that positioning is now handled dynamically
- This simplifies the configuration files and centralizes adjustment logic

### 2. Enhanced Model Initialization
- Updated the model creation process to apply default positions based on model type
- Added logic to load saved adjustments during initial model creation
- Implemented fallback to model-specific defaults when no saved adjustments exist

### 3. Improved Model-Specific Adjustments
- Refactored the `applyModelSpecificAdjustments` method to use a cleaner switch-case approach
- Added default positions for all character types (knight, skeleton, monk, etc.)
- Improved logging to provide better visibility into applied adjustments

### 4. Added Helper Methods
- Added `getCurrentModelId()` method to retrieve the current model ID
- Added `getCurrentModel()` method to access the full model configuration
- These methods support the dynamic adjustment system and UI panel

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Configuration**: Model configurations are now cleaner and focused only on essential properties.

2. **Centralized Adjustment Logic**: All positioning logic is now in the PlayerModel class rather than spread across configuration files.

3. **Consistent Default Positions**: Each model type has consistent default positions that are applied when no saved adjustments exist.

4. **Better Extensibility**: Adding new model types with specific positioning requirements is now easier and more structured.

## Usage Example

The system now automatically applies appropriate default positions based on model type:

- Knight models are positioned at Y=2.0 to keep them above ground
- Skeleton models are positioned at Y=0.5 for proper placement
- Other models use standard positioning at Y=0

These defaults are applied automatically, but can be overridden using the adjustment UI panel or programmatically using the provided methods.

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding a configuration file specifically for default model adjustments
- Implement animation-specific positioning adjustments
- Add support for model-specific terrain height offsets
