# Animation Utils Refactoring

## Overview
Refactored the animation system to fully utilize the `AnimationUtils` module for all animation-related functionality. This improves code organization, reusability, and maintainability by centralizing animation logic in a single utility module.

## Changes Made

1. Enhanced `AnimationUtils.js`:
   - Added a new `detectModelType` function to identify model types based on animation names
   - This function can detect Skeleton King models and standard models with common animation names
   - Returns detailed model type information for use in animation handling

2. Updated `PlayerModel.js`:
   - Refactored the animation initialization code to use `AnimationUtils`
   - Added a new `initializeDefaultAnimation` method that uses `AnimationUtils` to determine and play the appropriate starting animation
   - Simplified the model loading code by delegating animation handling to the utility functions

3. Updated `updateStateBasedAnimations` in `AnimationUtils.js`:
   - Now uses the `detectModelType` utility function for consistent model type detection
   - Maintains the special handling for Skeleton King models

## Benefits

- **Improved Code Organization**: Animation logic is now centralized in the `AnimationUtils` module
- **Consistent Model Detection**: The same model detection logic is used throughout the codebase
- **Better Maintainability**: Changes to animation handling only need to be made in one place
- **Enhanced Extensibility**: New model types can be easily added to the detection system

## Future Improvements

- Create a configuration-based animation mapping system for different model types
- Add support for more specialized animations based on different player actions
- Implement a more sophisticated animation blending system for smoother transitions
- Consider adding animation event callbacks for triggering effects at specific animation points
