# Fixed Leg and Hand Movement Animation

## Summary
Fixed issues with leg and hand animations not working properly during player movement. Enhanced the movement state management and added debugging to ensure proper animation transitions.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Animation System**
   - Added debug logging to track player movement state
   - Improved error handling for missing model parts
   - Added proper state transitions between moving and idle states

2. **Movement State Management**
   - Updated PlayerMovement class to properly set and maintain movement state
   - Added running state detection based on movement speed and distance
   - Improved state transitions when starting and stopping movement

3. **Debugging Tools**
   - Added debugModelParts() method to verify all required model parts exist
   - Added console logging for movement state changes
   - Added validation for model part references before animation

4. **Animation Improvements**
   - Fixed body bounce animation to maintain proper base position
   - Added proper state checking before applying animations
   - Improved error handling for animation system

## Technical Details

- Fixed potential issues with model parts not being properly referenced
- Added state validation to ensure animations are only applied when appropriate
- Improved movement state management for both keyboard and target-based movement
- Added debugging to help identify and fix animation issues

## Future Improvements

- Add smoother transitions between animation states
- Implement animation blending for more natural movement
- Add more varied animation styles based on terrain and movement speed
- Implement foot IK (Inverse Kinematics) for better ground contact
