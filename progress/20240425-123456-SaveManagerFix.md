# SaveManager Fix - Inventory Iteration Error

## Issue
The game was experiencing an error during the save process:
```
SaveManager.js:94 Error saving game: TypeError: player.inventory is not iterable
    at SaveManager.getPlayerData (SaveManager.js:192:35)
    at SaveManager.saveGame (SaveManager.js:62:30)
    at SaveManager.js:33:18
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the code was trying to spread the player's inventory with `[...player.inventory]`, but `player.inventory` is an instance of the `PlayerInventory` class, not an array. The actual inventory array is stored in the `inventory` property of the `PlayerInventory` class.

## Solution
1. Modified `getPlayerData()` method in `SaveManager.js` to use the `getInventory()` method to access the inventory array:
   ```javascript
   inventory: [...player.getInventory()], // Use getInventory() method to get the array
   ```

2. Modified `loadPlayerData()` method in `SaveManager.js` to properly load the inventory data:
   ```javascript
   // Load inventory - clear existing inventory and add each item
   player.inventory.inventory = []; // Clear the inventory array
   if (playerData.inventory && Array.isArray(playerData.inventory)) {
       playerData.inventory.forEach(item => {
           player.addToInventory(item);
       });
   }
   ```

## Files Modified

## Testing
The changes ensure that:
1. When saving the game, the inventory array is properly accessed using the `getInventory()` method
2. When loading the game, the inventory items are properly added to the player's inventory using the `addToInventory()` method

These changes should resolve the TypeError that was occurring during the save process.
