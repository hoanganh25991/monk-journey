# Collision Methods Fix

## Issue
After refactoring the Player class, an error occurred during gameplay:
```
Uncaught TypeError: this.player.getCollisionRadius is not a function
    at CollisionManager.checkPlayerEnemyCollisions (CollisionManager.js:35:42)
    at CollisionManager.update (CollisionManager.js:18:14)
    at Game.animate (Game.js:315:31)
    at Game.js:281:42
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by missing collision-related methods in the refactored Player class:

1. In the original monolithic Player class, the `collisionRadius` property was directly accessible
2. In the refactored Player class, this property was moved to the PlayerMovement component
3. The PlayerMovement component had a `getCollisionRadius()` method, but the Player class wasn't delegating to it
4. The CollisionManager was still trying to call `getCollisionRadius()` on the Player instance

## Solution
The solution involved adding delegation methods to the Player class for collision-related functionality:

1. Added `getCollisionRadius()` method to delegate to PlayerMovement:
   ```javascript
   getCollisionRadius() {
       return this.movement.getCollisionRadius();
   }
   ```

2. Added `getHeightOffset()` method for completeness:
   ```javascript
   getHeightOffset() {
       return this.movement.getHeightOffset();
   }
   ```

## Benefits
1. **Preserved API**: The CollisionManager can continue to use the same methods
2. **Encapsulation**: Implementation details are hidden behind the Player interface
3. **Consistency**: All movement-related methods are now properly delegated

## Future Improvements
1. Consider adding JSDoc comments to document the delegation methods
2. Add unit tests to verify the collision detection works correctly
3. Review other manager classes for potential missing method delegations
