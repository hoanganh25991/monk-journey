# Game Initialization Flow Implementation

## Overview
This update improves the game initialization flow to ensure a clear separation between game initialization (loading resources) and game start (beginning gameplay). The game now properly initializes in a paused state, with enemies and player inactive until the user explicitly clicks "New Game" or "Load Game".

## Changes Made

1. Updated `main.js` to clarify the initialization process:
   - Added more detailed comments explaining the initialization and start flow
   - Enhanced console logging to better track the game state
   - Made it explicit that initialization loads resources but keeps the game paused

2. Improved the "New Game" button click handler:
   - Added clear console logging for game start events
   - Added explicit comments about what happens when the game starts
   - Clarified that starting the game activates enemies and player movement

3. Enhanced the "Load Game" button click handler:
   - Added detailed console logging for the load game process
   - Improved error handling with console error messages
   - Added explicit comments about the game state changes

## Technical Details

The game initialization flow now follows these distinct steps:

1. **DOM Content Loaded**:
   - Loading screen is displayed
   - Game instance is created

2. **Game Initialization** (`game.init()`):
   - Resources are loaded (models, textures, audio)
   - Scene is set up
   - Game remains in paused state (`isPaused = true`)
   - Loading screen is hidden when complete
   - Main menu is displayed

3. **Game Start** (when user clicks "New Game" or "Load Game"):
   - Game state changes to running (`isPaused = false`)
   - Animation loop begins updating game logic
   - Enemies become active
   - Player can move and interact
   - Settings button becomes visible

This implementation ensures that the game world is fully loaded but inactive until the player explicitly chooses to start playing, providing a clean and professional user experience.
