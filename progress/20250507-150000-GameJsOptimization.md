# Game.js Optimization

## Changes Made

1. Identified the existing structure of Game.js and related files
2. Analyzed the code to identify areas for improvement
3. Verified that the optimized structure was already in place:
   - GameInterface.js - Interface defining core game operations
   - GameEventManager.js - Manages game events and event listeners
   - GameAccessors.js - Provides accessor methods for game components
   - GameFacade.js - Main facade class implementing the interface

4. Updated main.js to use GameFacade instead of Game
5. Verified that no other files were directly importing Game.js

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Organization**:
   - Separated concerns into distinct classes
   - Each class has a single responsibility
   - Clear interfaces between components

2. **Better Maintainability**:
   - Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
   - Interface-based design makes future changes more predictable
   - Reduced duplication of code

3. **Enhanced Extensibility**:
   - New game features can be added by extending the appropriate component
   - The facade pattern provides a stable API for client code

## Next Steps

1. Remove the original Game.js file once all references have been updated
2. Update any documentation to reflect the new structure
3. Consider adding unit tests for the new components
