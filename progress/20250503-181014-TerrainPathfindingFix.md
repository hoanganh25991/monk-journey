# Terrain Pathfinding Fix Implementation

## Problem
Players could still pass through higher terrain when clicking to move to a distant location at a lower height. The previous fixes only addressed terrain collision at the current position but didn't account for the entire movement path.

## Solution
The solution involved implementing a waypoint-based pathfinding system that follows the terrain contours:

1. **Waypoint-Based Pathfinding**:
   - Added a system to create a series of waypoints along the path to the target
   - Each waypoint is positioned at the correct terrain height
   - The player moves from waypoint to waypoint, following the terrain

2. **Enhanced Player Movement**:
   - Modified the `moveTo` method to create a path of waypoints to the target
   - Updated the movement logic to navigate through waypoints sequentially
   - Added properties to track the final destination and current waypoint

## Implementation Details

### Path Creation
When the player clicks to move to a location, we now create a path of waypoints:

```javascript
createPathToTarget() {
    if (!this.game || !this.game.world) {
        // If no world reference, just set direct target
        this.targetPosition.copy(this.finalTargetPosition);
        return;
    }
    
    // Calculate direct path to target
    const direction = new THREE.Vector3().subVectors(this.finalTargetPosition, this.position).normalize();
    const distance = this.position.distanceTo(this.finalTargetPosition);
    
    // Create waypoints along the path
    this.waypoints = [];
    
    // Add current position as first waypoint
    this.waypoints.push(this.position.clone());
    
    // Maximum step size for checking terrain (smaller values = more precise but more expensive)
    const stepSize = 2.0;
    const numSteps = Math.ceil(distance / stepSize);
    
    // Create intermediate waypoints
    for (let i = 1; i <= numSteps; i++) {
        const t = i / numSteps;
        const x = this.position.x + direction.x * distance * t;
        const z = this.position.z + direction.z * distance * t;
        const terrainHeight = this.game.world.getTerrainHeight(x, z);
        
        const waypoint = new THREE.Vector3(x, terrainHeight + this.heightOffset, z);
        this.waypoints.push(waypoint);
    }
    
    // Set the next waypoint as the immediate target
    if (this.waypoints.length > 1) {
        this.currentWaypointIndex = 1;
        this.targetPosition.copy(this.waypoints[this.currentWaypointIndex]);
    } else {
        // Fallback to direct path if no waypoints
        this.targetPosition.copy(this.finalTargetPosition);
    }
}
```

### Waypoint Navigation
The player now moves through waypoints sequentially:

```javascript
// Reached current waypoint
if (this.waypoints && this.currentWaypointIndex < this.waypoints.length - 1) {
    // Move to next waypoint
    this.currentWaypointIndex++;
    this.targetPosition.copy(this.waypoints[this.currentWaypointIndex]);
} else {
    // Reached final target
    this.state.isMoving = false;
    this.waypoints = null;
}
```

## Results
With these changes, the player now properly follows the terrain contours when moving to distant locations. Instead of passing through higher terrain, the player will move along a path that follows the terrain's surface, creating a more realistic movement experience.
