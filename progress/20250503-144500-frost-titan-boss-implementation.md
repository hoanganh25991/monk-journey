# Frost Titan Boss Implementation - May 3, 2025

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a new boss enemy, the Frost Titan, for the Diablo Immortal game. The Frost Titan is a powerful ice-based enemy with unique abilities and attack patterns.

## Boss Characteristics

### Basic Stats
- **Name**: Frost Titan
- **Health**: 600
- **Damage**: 40
- **Speed**: 2.0
- **Attack Range**: 3
- **Attack Speed**: 1.0
- **Experience Value**: 350
- **Scale**: 3x normal enemy size

### Visual Design
The Frost Titan features a crystalline ice-based design with the following elements:
- Massive ice body with translucent blue coloring
- Crystalline head structure with a crown of ice spikes
- Ice spikes on shoulders
- Crystalline arms and legs
- Ice staff with a glowing crystal at the end
- Particle effects creating a frost aura around the boss

### Special Abilities

The Frost Titan has three unique special abilities:

1. **Ice Storm**
   - Creates a storm of ice particles above the player
   - Particles fall and deal damage to the player if they're in the affected area
   - Deals 20% of the boss's base damage per hit
   - 8-second cooldown
   - Visual effect: Swirling ice particles falling from above

2. **Frost Nova**
   - Releases a ring of frost energy that expands outward
   - Deals 50% of the boss's base damage to the player if caught in the nova
   - Slows the player's movement speed by 50% for 2 seconds
   - 12-second cooldown
   - Visual effect: Expanding ring with ice spikes

3. **Ice Barrier**
   - Creates a protective ice shield around the boss
   - Reduces incoming damage by 75% for 5 seconds
   - Used when health drops below 30%
   - 20-second cooldown
   - Visual effect: Translucent sphere with orbiting ice crystals

## Implementation Details

### Code Structure
The Frost Titan implementation involved modifications to the following files:
1. `EnemyManager.js` - Added the boss type and spawn methods
2. `Enemy.js` - Added model creation and special abilities

### Model Creation
The Frost Titan model is created using Three.js geometric primitives:
- Body: BoxGeometry with translucent material
- Head: DodecahedronGeometry for crystalline appearance
- Crown: CylinderGeometry with ice spikes
- Arms and Legs: CylinderGeometry with varying dimensions
- Staff: CylinderGeometry with OctahedronGeometry crystal
- Particles: SphereGeometry for frost aura

### AI Behavior
The Frost Titan has specialized AI behavior:
- Uses Ice Storm when the player is at medium range (between attack range and 10 units)
- Uses Frost Nova when the player is close (within 1.5x attack range)
- Uses Ice Barrier defensively when health is low (below 30%)
- Falls back to standard melee attacks when abilities are on cooldown

### Integration with Quest System
The Frost Titan is integrated into the quest system as a boss for "main_quest_5" and spawns in the snowy mountains area at coordinates (20, 0, 20).

## Testing

To test the Frost Titan in-game:
1. Progress to "main_quest_5" to encounter the boss naturally, or
2. Use the developer console to spawn the boss manually:
   ```javascript
   game.enemyManager.spawnFrostTitan(0, 0); // Spawns at origin
   ```

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the Frost Titan in future updates:
1. Add more complex attack patterns and ability combinations
2. Implement phases based on health percentage
3. Add unique loot drops specific to this boss
4. Create a dedicated arena with environmental hazards
5. Add custom sound effects for abilities and attacks

## Conclusion

The Frost Titan boss adds a new challenging enemy to the game with unique visual design and gameplay mechanics. The ice-based abilities provide variety to the combat experience and require different strategies from the player compared to other bosses.
