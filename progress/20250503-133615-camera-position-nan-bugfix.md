# Camera Position NaN Bugfix - May 3, 2025

## Issue Summary
The game was experiencing a critical issue where the camera position was showing NaN (Not a Number) values for the y and z coordinates. This resulted in the camera not rendering the scene properly, with only a blue sky background visible to the player.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was traced to several functions that didn't properly validate input coordinates or handle NaN values:

1. The `getTerrainHeight` method in `World.js` didn't check for invalid input coordinates, which could lead to NaN propagation.
2. The `updateCamera` method in `Player.js` didn't validate the camera position before applying it.
3. The `setPosition` method in `Player.js` didn't check for NaN values in the input coordinates.
4. The `checkPlayerTerrainCollisions` method in `CollisionManager.js` didn't validate the player position or terrain height.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. World.js - getTerrainHeight Method
- Added validation for NaN or undefined input coordinates
- Added bounds checking for terrain coordinates
- Added validation for height values
- Added a final safety check to ensure the returned height is never NaN

### 2. Player.js - updateCamera Method
- Added validation for player position before using it
- Added reset logic to set player to a safe position if invalid
- Added validation for camera position before applying it
- Added validation for camera target before looking at it

### 3. Player.js - setPosition Method
- Added validation for input coordinates
- Added early return to prevent setting invalid positions

### 4. CollisionManager.js - checkPlayerTerrainCollisions Method
- Added validation for player position
- Added reset logic to set player to a safe position if invalid
- Added validation for terrain height
- Added fallback to a safe height if terrain height is invalid

## Testing
The fixes were implemented to handle all edge cases where NaN values might be introduced. The game should now gracefully recover from any invalid position or height calculations, ensuring the camera always maintains a valid position and orientation.

## Future Improvements
1. Add more comprehensive logging to track when and why NaN values are being introduced
2. Implement unit tests to verify coordinate validation
3. Add a global error boundary to catch and handle unexpected NaN values in any part of the game
