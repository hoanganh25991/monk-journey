# Flat Terrain Implementation

## Overview
Modified the terrain system to create a completely flat terrain with only grass, removing all elevation changes. This creates a perfectly flat playing field for improved gameplay experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified `getTerrainHeight` Method in World.js
- Replaced the complex terrain height calculation with a constant value of 0
- This ensures that the terrain is perfectly flat with no elevation changes

### 2. Modified Terrain Generation
- Updated the `generateHeightMap` method to create a completely flat terrain
- Set all height values to 0 instead of using noise-based generation

### 3. Updated Terrain Coloring
- Modified the `colorTerrain` method to use only grass colors
- Added slight color variations to maintain a natural grass appearance

### 4. Adjusted Water Level
- Lowered the water level from 1.5 to 0.15 to match the flat terrain
- This ensures water remains visible but doesn't flood the flat terrain

### Technical Implementation
The implementation focuses on:
1. Simplifying the terrain height calculation to always return 0
2. Generating a completely flat heightmap
3. Using only grass colors for the terrain
4. Adjusting the water level to match the flat terrain

## Benefits
- Perfectly flat playing field with no elevation changes
- Improved gameplay experience with consistent movement
- Simplified terrain system that's easier to understand and maintain
- Maintained the existing entity positioning system
- Entities are properly positioned and fully visible

## Testing
The changes should be immediately visible in-game, with players and enemies moving on a completely flat terrain with no elevation changes. All entities should be fully visible and properly positioned above the terrain.
