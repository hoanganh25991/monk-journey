# Exploding Palm Auto-Targeting Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the Exploding Palm skill with auto-targeting functionality and fixed orientation issues. The palm now automatically aims at the nearest enemy and maintains proper orientation throughout its flight.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Palm Orientation
- Corrected the palm's rotation so that fingers point upward (to the sky) instead of down to the ground
- Changed the hand rotation values in `createMarkEffect()`:
  ```javascript
  // Changed from:
  handGroup.rotation.x = Math.PI / 2;
  handGroup.rotation.z = Math.PI;
  
  // To:
  handGroup.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2; // Negative value to make fingers point up
  handGroup.rotation.z = 0;
  ```

### 2. Implemented Auto-Targeting
- Added logic to find the nearest enemy within range during the palm's flight
- The palm now dynamically adjusts its direction to track the nearest enemy
- Updated the palm's movement to follow the target direction
- Added proper rotation of the palm group to face the target

### 3. Fixed Direction Alignment
- Completely revised the direction handling system for Exploding Palm
- Ensured the palm always moves in the same direction the hero is facing initially
- Fixed the issue where the palm would move backward when pressing "7" while moving forward with "W"
- Implemented a priority-based direction system:
  1. First frame: Always use the player's facing direction
  2. Subsequent frames: Target nearest enemy if available
  3. If no enemy: Continue in initial direction
- Added extensive debug logging to track direction values throughout the skill's lifecycle
- Ensured the palm moves in a direct line toward the nearest enemy
- Fixed the issue where the palm wasn't exactly on the line from hero to nearest enemy

## Technical Implementation
- Added enemy detection in the `updateMarkEffect()` method
- Implemented dynamic direction adjustment based on nearest enemy position
- Fixed rotation values to ensure proper visual orientation
- Maintained the palm's ability to track and hit enemies

## Benefits
- More intuitive skill usage - the palm automatically finds targets
- Improved visual appearance with correct palm orientation
- Better gameplay experience with skills that respond to the environment
- Increased effectiveness of the Exploding Palm skill in combat

## Future Considerations
- Further refinement of targeting priority (e.g., prioritize low health enemies)
- Add visual indicator to show which enemy is being targeted
- Consider adding a slight homing effect to improve hit probability
