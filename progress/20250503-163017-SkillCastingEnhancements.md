# Skill Casting Enhancements

## Changes Made

1. **Reduced Cooldown for All Skills**
   - Modified the `initializeSkills` method in `Player.js`
   - Set all skill cooldowns to 0.5 seconds (previously ranged from 3 to 15 seconds)
   - Added comments to indicate the reduced cooldown values

2. **Removed Skill Locking Mechanism**
   - Modified the `useSkill` method in `Player.js`
   - Removed the code that set `this.state.isUsingSkill = true`
   - Removed the timeout that reset `this.state.isUsingSkill = false` after 500ms
   - This allows multiple skills to be cast simultaneously without waiting for the previous skill to finish

## Benefits

1. **Faster Gameplay**
   - Players can cast skills more frequently with the reduced cooldown
   - Enhances the action-oriented nature of the game

2. **More Dynamic Combat**
   - Players can now chain multiple skills together without waiting
   - Allows for more creative skill combinations and strategies

3. **Improved Player Experience**
   - Removes frustrating limitations on skill usage
   - Provides a more fluid and responsive gameplay experience

## Technical Implementation

The changes were focused on two key areas:

1. **Cooldown Reduction**
   ```javascript
   // Example of cooldown change
   cooldown: 0.5, // Reduced from 8 seconds
   ```

2. **Skill Locking Removal**
   - Removed these lines from the `useSkill` method:
   ```javascript
   // Set skill state
   this.state.isUsingSkill = true;
   
   // Reset skill state after delay
   setTimeout(() => {
       this.state.isUsingSkill = false;
   }, 500);
   ```

These changes maintain all the existing functionality while enhancing the player's ability to cast skills more freely.
