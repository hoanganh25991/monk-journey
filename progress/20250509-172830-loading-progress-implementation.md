# Loading Progress Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds detailed loading progress indicators for the initial page load on slow networks. Previously, the game would appear to freeze during the initial load, especially on slow connections. Now, users will see a progress bar and detailed information about what's being loaded.

## Changes Made

### 1. Initial Load Progress Tracking
- Created a new file `pwa/initial-load-progress.js` that tracks the loading of critical resources during the initial page load
- This script is loaded in the `<head>` section of the HTML to start tracking as early as possible
- Uses the Performance API to monitor resource loading in real-time
- Provides fallback mechanisms for browsers without full Performance API support

### 2. Enhanced Loading Screen
- Updated the `LoadingScreen.js` class to show more detailed progress information
- Added text elements to display the current loading status and details
- Implemented a more realistic progress tracking system based on resource weights
- Added a smooth transition between the initial loading indicator and the game's loading screen

### 3. Game Initialization Progress
- Modified the `Game.js` file to report detailed progress during the initialization process
- Added progress updates at key points in the initialization sequence
- Implemented error handling to show loading failures
- Added a new `updateLoadingProgress` method to centralize progress updates

## How It Works

1. **Initial Page Load**:
   - `initial-load-progress.js` creates a loading indicator as soon as possible
   - Tracks the loading of critical resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
   - Shows real-time progress with percentage and file information

2. **Game Loading**:
   - Once the initial resources are loaded, the game's loading screen takes over
   - Shows detailed progress of game initialization (renderer, world, player, etc.)
   - Provides informative messages about what's happening

3. **Transition**:
   - Smooth transition between initial loading and game loading
   - Progress is preserved between the two phases

## Benefits

- Users see immediate feedback when the page starts loading
- Detailed progress information prevents the perception of the game "freezing"
- Clear error messages if something goes wrong during loading
- Improved user experience, especially on slow networks

## Technical Details

- Uses the Performance API for accurate resource tracking
- Fallback mechanisms for older browsers
- Weighted progress calculation for more realistic progress indication
- Modular design that separates initial loading from game loading
