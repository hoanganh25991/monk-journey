# Moving Legs Implementation

## Summary
Enhanced the player model with advanced leg movement animations, including walking, running, idle weight shifting, and jumping animations. The implementation follows Ghibli-style animation principles with exaggerated movements and fluid transitions.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Leg Animation System**
   - Added `animateLegs()` method with proper joint articulation
   - Implemented realistic knee bending during walking/running
   - Added foot flexing for push-off and landing phases
   - Created natural hip sway and body lean during movement

2. **Idle Leg Animation**
   - Added subtle weight shifting between legs during idle state
   - Implemented small knee adjustments for more lifelike idle stance
   - Created natural body sway to avoid static appearance

3. **Jump Animation**
   - Added complete jump animation sequence with preparation, execution, and landing phases
   - Implemented realistic knee bending during jump preparation and landing
   - Created parabolic jump trajectory with proper timing
   - Added arm coordination during jumping

4. **State Management**
   - Added running and jumping states to PlayerState
   - Updated PlayerInterface to include new animation methods
   - Added foot group references to model parts for animation

## Technical Details

- Used sine waves with proper phase relationships for natural walking cycles
- Implemented different animation parameters for walking vs. running
- Created proper joint hierarchies with anatomically correct movement
- Added Ghibli-style exaggeration to movements for more character
- Used callback-based animation sequences for complex movements like jumping

## Future Improvements

- Add directional leg animations for strafing and backward movement
- Implement foot IK (Inverse Kinematics) for better ground contact
- Add more character-specific animation styles
- Create transition animations between different movement states
