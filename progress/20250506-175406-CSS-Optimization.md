# CSS Optimization

## Overview
This update optimizes the CSS structure by breaking down the monolithic `style.css` file into modular, purpose-specific CSS files. This improves maintainability, reduces duplication, and makes the codebase easier to understand and extend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modular CSS Structure
Created the following CSS files:
- `reset.css` - Basic reset and global styles
- `layout.css` - Main layout containers and positioning
- `components.css` - UI components (health bars, skills, etc.)
- `animations.css` - All keyframes and animation-related styles
- `mobile.css` - Mobile-specific overrides
- `utilities.css` - Common utility classes
- `main.css` - Main file that imports all modular CSS files

### 2. Optimizations
- Removed duplicate style declarations
- Consolidated similar styles
- Created reusable utility classes
- Improved organization with logical grouping
- Separated mobile-specific styles for better maintainability

### 3. Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability**: Each file has a specific purpose, making it easier to find and modify styles
- **Better Performance**: Reduced redundancy and optimized selectors
- **Enhanced Readability**: Logical organization makes the code easier to understand
- **Easier Collaboration**: Team members can work on different CSS modules without conflicts
- **Simplified Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific CSS modules

### 4. HTML Update
- Updated `index.html` to reference the new `main.css` file instead of `style.css`

## Technical Details
- Used CSS imports to maintain a single entry point (`main.css`)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing HTML structure
- Added comprehensive comments to explain the purpose of each file
- Created utility classes for common styling patterns

## Future Improvements
- Consider using CSS variables for consistent theming
- Implement a CSS minification process for production
- Add responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
- Create component-specific CSS files as the application grows
