# SaveManager Bug Fix

## Issue
The game was encountering an error when trying to save:
```
Error saving game: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')
    at SaveManager.getPlayerData (SaveManager.js:185:36)
    at SaveManager.saveGame (SaveManager.js:62:30)
    at SaveManager.js:33:18
```

## Root Cause
In the `getPlayerData` method of `SaveManager.js`, the code was trying to access `player.position.x`, but in some cases `player.position` was undefined, causing the error.

## Solution
Modified the `getPlayerData` method to check if `player.position` exists before trying to access its properties. If it doesn't exist, a default position of `{x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}` is used instead.

## Changes Made
- Added a null check for `player.position` in the `getPlayerData` method
- Created a default position object when `player.position` is undefined

## Files Modified
- `/Users/anhle/work-station/diablo-immortal/js/core/SaveManager.js`

## Testing
The fix should prevent the error from occurring when saving the game. The game will now use a default position (0,0,0) if the player position is undefined, allowing the save operation to complete successfully.
