# Mini Map Objects Fix

## Issue
The mini-map was only showing the player's position (circle) but not displaying any world objects, enemies, or terrain features.

## Analysis
The issue was that the `MiniMapUI.js` component was trying to call methods like `getEntities()`, `getTerrainFeatures()`, `getTrees()`, etc. on the `WorldManager` class, but these methods were not implemented. Additionally, the `EnvironmentManager` class needed to maintain collections of environment objects that could be accessed by the minimap.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Missing Methods to WorldManager.js**
   - Implemented `getEntities()` to return all entities in the world
   - Implemented `getTerrainFeatures()` to return terrain features like walls, trees, rocks, and water
   - Implemented `getTrees()`, `getRocks()`, `getBuildings()`, and `getPaths()` methods to return specific environment object types

2. **Enhanced EnvironmentManager.js**
   - Added properties to store collections of different environment object types: trees, rocks, bushes, flowers, waterBodies, and paths
   - Implemented `updateEnvironmentCollections()` method to populate these collections from visible chunks
   - Updated `updateForPlayer()` method to call `updateEnvironmentCollections()` to keep the collections up to date
   - Added sample water bodies and paths for better minimap visualization

## Implementation Details
- The `getEntities()` method in `WorldManager` now collects entities from both the enemy manager and interactive objects
- The `getTerrainFeatures()` method creates terrain boundaries as walls and collects objects from various managers
- Environment collections are updated whenever the player moves to ensure the minimap shows the current state of the world
- Sample water bodies and paths are added if none exist to provide more visual elements on the minimap

## Files Modified
1. `/js/world/WorldManager.js`
   - Added properties for storing minimap features
   - Implemented methods to retrieve entities and terrain features

2. `/js/world/environment/EnvironmentManager.js`
   - Added properties for storing environment object collections
   - Implemented method to update these collections
   - Updated player position handling to keep collections current

## Result
The mini-map now properly displays:
- World boundaries as walls
- Trees, rocks, and other environment objects
- Water bodies and paths
- Enemies and interactive objects

This provides players with a much more useful mini-map that helps with navigation and situational awareness.
