# HUD Game State Consistency Implementation

## Changes Made

1. Modified `HUDManager.js`:
   - Added event listener for game state changes in the constructor
   - Added `handleGameStateChange` method to show/hide UI based on game state
   - Modified `init` method to initially hide UI if game is not running
   - Updated `validateUIContainer` to not force visibility (controlled by game state)

2. Fixed `Game.js`:
   - Corrected reference from `hudManager` to `uiManager`
   - Updated UI manager update call to pass delta parameter

## Implementation Details

- The HUD now listens for 'gameStateChanged' events from the Game
- When game state is 'running', all UI elements are shown
- When game state is 'paused', all UI elements are hidden
- Initial UI visibility is determined by the game's running state at initialization

## Testing

To test these changes:
1. Start the game - UI should be hidden initially
2. Run the game - UI should appear
3. Pause the game - UI should disappear
4. Resume the game - UI should reappear
