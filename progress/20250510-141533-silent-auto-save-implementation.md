# Silent Auto-Save Implementation

## Changes Made

1. Modified the `saveGame` method in `SaveManager.js` to:
   - Add a new `auto` parameter (default: `false`) to indicate auto-saves
   - Fix the undefined `shouldSaveByLevel` variable by properly defining it
   - Use the silent `saveWorldChunks` method for auto-saves instead of `saveWorldChunksWithProgress`
   - Suppress UI notifications for auto-saves while still logging them

2. Updated the `startAutoSave` method to:
   - Pass `auto=true` to the `saveGame` method when auto-saving

## Benefits

- Auto-saves now happen silently in the background without UI notifications
- Manual saves still show progress and notifications
- Fixed a bug where `shouldSaveByLevel` was used but not defined
- Improved code clarity by explicitly indicating auto-saves

## Technical Details

- The `saveGame` method now accepts two parameters:
  - `forceSave` (default: `false`): Whether to force save regardless of conditions
  - `auto` (default: `false`): Whether this is an auto-save (silent, no UI)
- For auto-saves, we use the non-progress version of world chunk saving
- Notifications are only shown for non-auto saves
- Logging still happens for all save operations

## Testing

To test these changes:
1. Verify that auto-saves occur silently without UI notifications
2. Confirm that manual saves still show progress and notifications
3. Check that the game state is properly saved in both cases
