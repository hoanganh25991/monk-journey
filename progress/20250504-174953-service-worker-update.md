# Service Worker Update Script Enhancement

## Task Completed
Successfully updated the `update-service-worker.js` script to handle both creating and updating the service-worker.js file.

## Changes Made
1. Modified the `updateServiceWorker()` function to:
   - Check if the service-worker.js file exists
   - Create a new one if it doesn't exist
   - Update the existing one if it does exist

2. Added error handling to:
   - Catch errors during the update process
   - Fall back to creating a new service worker if updating fails

## Testing Results
- Successfully created a new service-worker.js file when it didn't exist
- Successfully updated the service-worker.js file and incremented the cache version from 1 to 2

## Benefits
- More robust script that handles both creation and updates
- Automatic fallback to creation if update fails
- Maintains proper versioning for cache management
- Ensures all project assets are properly cached for offline use

## Next Steps
The script is now fully functional for both creating and updating the service worker. No further changes are needed.
