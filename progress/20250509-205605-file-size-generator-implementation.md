# File Size Generator Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a new system for tracking file sizes and loading progress in the game. Instead of parsing the service worker file at runtime, we now generate a dedicated JSON file with file size information that can be loaded directly by the initial loading screen.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created File Size Generator Script
Created a new script at `scripts/generate-file-sizes.js` that:
- Scans the project directory for files
- Calculates file sizes
- Categorizes files by type (models, images, audio, JS, CSS, etc.)
- Generates a JSON file with all this information

### 2. Modified Initial Loading Progress
Updated `pwa/initial-load-progress.js` to:
- Load file size data from the new JSON file instead of parsing the service worker
- Fall back to the old method if the JSON file is not available
- Use pre-categorized files from the JSON file when available

### 3. Created Update Script
Added a shell script at `scripts/update-file-sizes.sh` that:
- Runs the file size generator
- Updates the service worker
- Makes it easy to keep both in sync

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Loading a small JSON file is faster than parsing the entire service worker
2. **Better Maintainability**: Separates concerns - service worker handles caching, JSON file handles size information
3. **Enhanced Reliability**: Provides a fallback mechanism if the JSON file fails to load
4. **More Accurate Progress**: Pre-categorized files allow for more realistic loading simulation

## How to Use

1. After making changes to the codebase, run:
   ```
   ./scripts/update-file-sizes.sh
   ```

2. This will update both the file-sizes.json and the service worker

## Technical Details

The file-sizes.json contains:
- Total size in bytes and MB
- Individual file sizes
- Files categorized by type
- Timestamp of when it was generated

The loading progress system uses this data to simulate realistic loading times for different file types, providing users with an accurate representation of loading progress.
