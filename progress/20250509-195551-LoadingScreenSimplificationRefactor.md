# Loading Screen Simplification Refactor

## Summary
Removed the `useSimpleProgress` feature from the LoadingScreen.js file to simplify the loading screen implementation. The code now exclusively uses the resource-based progress tracking method, which provides a more detailed and realistic loading experience.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed properties and parameters:**
   - Removed `useSimpleProgress` property from the constructor
   - Removed `progressIncrement` property from the constructor
   - Removed `useSimpleProgress` parameter from the `show()` method

2. **Simplified methods:**
   - Modified `show()` method to always use resource-based progress tracking
   - Updated `updateProgress()` method to remove conditional logic related to `useSimpleProgress`
   - Removed `setProgressIncrement()` method as it's no longer needed
   - Removed `trackSimpleProgress()` method entirely

3. **Code cleanup:**
   - Fixed spacing and formatting issues
   - Updated comments to reflect the changes

## Benefits

1. **Simplified codebase:**
   - Reduced complexity by removing conditional logic
   - Eliminated redundant code paths
   - Made the loading screen behavior more predictable

2. **Improved user experience:**
   - Consistent loading experience with detailed progress information
   - More accurate progress tracking based on resource loading
   - Better visual feedback during the loading process

## Testing Notes

The loading screen now always uses the resource-based progress tracking method, which provides:
- Detailed progress information for each resource type
- Weighted progress calculation based on resource importance
- More frequent updates (every 100ms vs 500ms previously)
