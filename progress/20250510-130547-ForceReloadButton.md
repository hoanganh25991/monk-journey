# Force Reload Button Implementation

## Overview
Added a "Force Reload" button to the GameMenu to allow users to perform a hard reload similar to Chrome's Ctrl+Shift+R functionality. This helps address issues with the service worker where multiple versions of the game may be loaded, causing files to be served from different versions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Button to HTML Structure
Modified `index.html` to add a new "Force Reload" button to the game menu:
```html
<button id="force-reload-button" class="menu-button">Force Reload</button>
```

### 2. Updated GameMenu.js
1. Added a reference to the new button in the constructor:
```javascript
this.forceReloadButton = document.getElementById('force-reload-button');
```

2. Implemented the event listener for the force reload button with the following functionality:
   - Shows a notification before reloading
   - Unregisters all service workers
   - Clears all caches using the Cache API
   - Performs a hard reload of the page

## Technical Details

The implementation follows these steps when the button is clicked:
1. Displays a notification to inform the user that a hard reload is in progress
2. Uses the Service Worker API to unregister all registered service workers
3. Uses the Cache API to delete all caches
4. Performs a hard reload using `window.location.reload(true)`

This ensures that:
- The service worker is completely unregistered
- All cached content is cleared
- The page is reloaded from the server, not from cache

## Benefits
- Resolves issues with multiple versions of the game being loaded simultaneously
- Provides users with a simple way to perform a clean reload without using keyboard shortcuts
- Helps prevent conflicts between different cached versions of game files
- Improves overall stability by ensuring a clean state when needed
