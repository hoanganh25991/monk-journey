# Mobile Tap Highlight Fix

## Overview
This update completely eliminates the persistent light blue box/highlight that appears when tapping on UI elements on mobile devices (Android and iOS). The fix uses multiple aggressive CSS techniques to ensure no highlight appears on any interactive element.

## Changes Made

### 1. Global Tap Highlight Removal
- Added `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` to the universal selector (`*`)
- Applied the same property to `html` and `body` elements
- Created a comprehensive selector targeting all possible interactive elements

### 2. Enhanced Button Styling
- Added `!important` to all `outline: none` declarations to force override any browser defaults
- Applied `-webkit-appearance: none` and `appearance: none` to normalize button appearance
- Added `-webkit-touch-callout: none` to prevent touch callout menus

### 3. Specific Mobile Targeting
- Created specific rules for active, focus, and hover states on all interactive elements
- Added rules that target child elements within interactive components
- Implemented multiple layers of protection to ensure the highlight is removed in all scenarios

### 4. Component-Specific Fixes
- Updated skill buttons with comprehensive anti-highlight rules
- Enhanced menu buttons with the same protective styling
- Applied special handling to the virtual joystick to prevent any highlighting

## Technical Implementation
The implementation uses multiple CSS techniques to ensure the tap highlight is completely removed:

1. Direct property application: `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent !important`
2. State targeting: Applying the fix to `:active`, `:focus`, and `:hover` states
3. Child element protection: Targeting all children with `*` selector
4. Forced override: Using `!important` to ensure browser defaults are overridden
5. Appearance normalization: Using `-webkit-appearance: none` and `appearance: none`

## Benefits
- Completely eliminates the distracting blue highlight box on mobile devices
- Creates a more native app-like experience for mobile users
- Maintains the circular aesthetic of buttons without rectangular highlights
- Improves the professional look and feel of the game interface

## Testing
This implementation has been designed to work across all modern mobile browsers, including:
- Safari on iOS
- Chrome on Android
- Firefox on Android
- Samsung Internet

The aggressive approach ensures that even the most stubborn browser defaults are overridden.
