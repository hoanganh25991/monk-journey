# Exploding Palm Skill Refinement

## Changes Made

### 1. Corrected Palm Orientation
- Rotated the palm 180 degrees (added `handGroup.rotation.z = Math.PI`) to position the fingers correctly pointing upward
- This gives a more natural and powerful appearance to the palm

### 2. Steady Movement Instead of Rotation
- Removed the spinning rotation effect that was previously applied to the palm
- Added a slight downward tilt to show the weight and power of the palm
- Replaced the rapid pulsing with a more subtle, slower pulse effect
- These changes make the palm appear more powerful and heavy

### 3. Added Ground Effects to Show Heaviness
- Added dust/debris particles that kick up from below the palm as it moves
  - Particles rise up and then fall back down with gravity
  - Particles fade out over time
  - This creates the impression that the palm is pushing air downward with its power

- Added ground impact rings that appear periodically as the palm moves
  - Rings expand outward from the palm's position
  - Rings fade out as they expand
  - This creates the impression that the palm is causing shockwaves as it moves

### 4. Improved Cleanup
- Added proper cleanup for the impact rings when the skill is removed
- This prevents memory leaks and visual artifacts

## Expected Results
The "Exploding Palm" skill should now:
1. Appear with fingers pointing upward in a more natural palm position
2. Move steadily forward without spinning, giving it a more powerful appearance
3. Create dust particles and impact rings on the ground as it moves, showing its heaviness
4. Look more like a powerful, heavy object moving through the air

## Visual Effects
- **Dust Particles**: Small brown/tan particles that rise from below the palm and fall with gravity
- **Impact Rings**: Red rings that expand outward on the ground beneath the palm
- **Subtle Tilt**: A slight downward tilt to the palm to show its weight
- **Slow Pulse**: A very subtle pulsing effect to show the palm's power

These changes should make the Exploding Palm skill look more impressive and powerful while maintaining its visibility and clarity.
