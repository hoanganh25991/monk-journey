# Save Manager Fix

## Issue
The game was failing to load with the error:
```
this.game.uiManager.updatePlayerUl is not a function
```

## Root Cause
In the `SaveManager.js` file, there was a call to a non-existent method `updatePlayerUI()` on the `uiManager` object. The HUDManager class doesn't have this method, but it does have a reference to the PlayerUI component, which has an `update()` method.

## Solution
Modified the `SaveManager.js` file to directly access the PlayerUI component and call its `update()` method instead of trying to call a non-existent method on the HUDManager.

### Changes Made
- In `js/core/save-manager/SaveManager.js`, replaced the call to `this.game.uiManager.updatePlayerUI()` with a direct call to `this.game.uiManager.components.playerUI.update()`.
- Added a null check to ensure the components object and playerUI component exist before trying to call the update method.

## Testing
The game should now be able to load saved games without encountering the "is not a function" error.
