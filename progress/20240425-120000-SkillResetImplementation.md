# Skill Reset Implementation

## Overview
This update implements a reset mechanism for skills and skill effects in the Diablo Immortal game. The changes allow skills to be properly reset after use, ensuring that when a skill is cast again, it creates a completely new effect without any residual state from previous casts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Reset Method to SkillEffect Base Class
- Implemented a `reset()` method in the `SkillEffect` base class that:
  - Disposes of any existing effect
  - Resets state variables like `isActive` and `elapsedTime`
  - Provides a foundation for derived classes to extend with their own reset logic

### 2. Added Reset Method to WaveSkillEffect Class
- Extended the base `reset()` method in `WaveSkillEffect` to handle wave-specific state:
  - Resets distance traveled and bell creation flags
  - Resets position and direction vectors
  - Properly resets the bell animation state to ensure a clean start for the next cast

### 3. Added Reset Method to Skill Class
- Implemented a `reset()` method in the `Skill` class that:
  - Resets skill state variables
  - Resets position and direction vectors
  - Calls the reset method on the effect handler
  - Returns the skill instance for method chaining

### 4. Modified Skill.createEffect Method
- Updated the `createEffect()` method to:
  - Reset the effect handler before creating a new effect
  - Reset skill state variables
  - Ensure a clean state for each new skill cast

## Benefits
- Prevents visual artifacts from previous skill casts
- Ensures consistent behavior when casting the same skill multiple times
- Improves performance by reusing objects instead of creating new ones
- Maintains proper game state for skill effects

## Testing
To test these changes:
1. Cast a skill and observe its effect
2. Wait for the skill to complete or manually end it
3. Cast the same skill again and verify that it appears completely fresh without any residual effects from the previous cast

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding reset methods to other specific skill effect classes
- Add more detailed logging for debugging
- Consider adding a global reset method to reset all skills at once
