# Enhanced Diablo Immortal-Style Skill Effects

## Overview
This update implements complex and visually impressive skill effects similar to Diablo Immortal, using Three.js primitives to create elaborate visual compositions. The implementation focuses on two skills initially:

1. **Wave Strike** - Transformed from a simple cone to a complex water wave with energy core
2. **Cyclone Strike** - Transformed from a basic ring to a dynamic tornado/cyclone effect

## Wave Strike Enhancement

### Visual Components
- Main wave body using a curved torus segment
- Water droplets/particles around the wave
- Foam/splash at the base
- Energy core in the center
- Energy tendrils emanating from the core
- Trailing wake behind the wave

### Animation Features
- Growing phase as the skill initiates
- Dynamic water droplet movement
- Rotating energy tendrils
- Pulsing energy core
- Stretching wake effect
- Smooth fade-out during dissipation

## Cyclone Strike Enhancement

### Visual Components
- Base cylinder at the bottom
- Multiple rotating torus layers creating the tornado shape
- Swirling particles of various shapes
- Energy core at the center
- Energy beams emanating from the core

### Animation Features
- Rotating cyclone with increasing speed
- Independently rotating layers
- Vertical oscillation of layers
- Particles moving in spiral patterns
- Pulsing energy core
- Rotating energy beams
- Particle regeneration system
- Smooth fade-out effect

## Technical Implementation
- Used Three.js primitives (torus, sphere, cylinder, etc.) to build complex shapes
- Implemented detailed animation systems with phase transitions
- Created particle systems with individual movement patterns
- Used emissive materials for energy effects
- Implemented proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Future Improvements
- Enhance remaining skills with similar complex effects
- Add sound synchronization with visual effects
- Implement impact effects when skills hit targets
- Add environmental interaction (like water ripples or ground cracks)
- Optimize performance for multiple simultaneous effects

The enhanced skill effects provide a much more immersive and visually impressive experience, closer to the high-quality effects seen in Diablo Immortal.
