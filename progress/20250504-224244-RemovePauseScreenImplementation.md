# Remove Pause Screen and Escape Key Functionality Implementation

## Changes Made

1. Removed the `createPauseMenu()` method from HUDManager.js
2. Removed the `togglePauseMenu()` method from HUDManager.js
3. Removed the initialization of the pause menu in the `init()` method
4. Removed the `showSettingsMenu()` method completely
5. Removed the `isPauseMenuOpen` property from the constructor
6. Updated the InputHandler.js to do nothing when the Escape key is pressed
7. Removed the Escape key reference from the controls section in the HTML

## Rationale

The pause screen and Escape key functionality were removed to simplify the user experience and reduce code complexity. This change ensures that pressing the Escape key does not trigger any action in the game.

## Impact

- Pressing the Escape key will no longer do anything
- The pause menu and settings menu accessed via Escape key are completely removed
- Users will need to access settings through other UI elements (like the settings button)
- The game flow will not be interrupted by accidental Escape key presses

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding a dedicated settings button in the game UI if needed
- Ensure all critical functionality previously accessible through the pause menu is available through other UI elements
