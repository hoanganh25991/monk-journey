# Game Pause and Menu System Implementation

## Summary
Enhanced the game's pause and menu system to ensure the game starts in a paused state and only begins when the user clicks on "New Game" or "Load Game" buttons. Added an event system to notify other parts of the code when the game state changes.

## Changes Made

1. Added an event system to the Game class:
   - Added `addEventListener`, `removeEventListener`, and `dispatchEvent` methods
   - Added event dispatching for game state changes (running, paused, menu)

2. Added a `setMenuState()` method to explicitly set the game to the menu state

3. Updated state transition methods to dispatch events:
   - `start()`: Dispatches 'running' state
   - `pause()`: Dispatches 'paused' state
   - `resume()`: Dispatches 'running' state
   - `togglePause()`: Dispatches 'paused' or 'running' state based on current state

4. Updated main.js to use the new `setMenuState()` method when showing the game menu

## Game State Flow

1. Game initializes with `isPaused = true`
2. After initialization, `setMenuState()` is called to set the game to the 'menu' state
3. The main menu is displayed, and the game remains paused
4. When the user clicks "New Game" or "Load Game", `game.start()` is called, which:
   - Sets `isPaused = false`
   - Starts the game loop
   - Dispatches the 'running' state

## Benefits

1. **Clear State Management**: Game has distinct states (menu, running, paused)
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Other components can react to game state changes
3. **Consistent Animation Loop**: Animation continues even when the game is paused
4. **User-Controlled Start**: Game only starts when the user explicitly chooses to start

## Testing Notes

- The game should start in a paused state with the main menu visible
- Clicking "New Game" or "Load Game" should start the game
- The settings button should only be visible when the game is running
- Pausing the game should trigger the appropriate UI changes
