# Combo Punch System Key Control Update

## Overview
Enhanced the combo punch system to only activate when the "H" key is pressed and held down. This gives the player more control over when to use the combo system, allowing for strategic timing of the powerful finisher punch.

## Changes Made

### Player.js
1. Modified the `updateComboPunch` method:
   - Added a check for the "H" key being held down using `inputHandler.skillKeysHeld.KeyH`
   - Only performs combo punches when the key is actively pressed
   - Allows combos in progress to expire naturally when the key is released
   - Added logging to indicate when the key is released during a combo

2. Updated the `useBasicAttack` method:
   - Changed to use the combo punch system's range instead of a fixed value
   - Removed direct punch execution from this method
   - Reset the punch cooldown to allow immediate punch when the key is first pressed
   - Added comments to clarify the flow between key press and combo execution

## Behavior Changes
- **Key Press Requirement**: Combo punches only execute while the "H" key is held down
- **Combo Continuation**: A combo in progress will expire naturally if the key is released
- **Combo Timer**: The combo timer still functions as before, allowing a window to continue the combo
- **Immediate Response**: When "H" is first pressed, the punch cooldown is reset for immediate action

## User Experience Improvements
- More precise control over when to punch
- Ability to stop punching by releasing the key
- Better strategic control over when to use the powerful knockback finisher
- Maintains the same visual effects and damage calculations

## Future Improvements
- Add a visual indicator for the current combo step
- Implement a combo counter UI element
- Add sound effects specific to each combo step
- Consider adding a "perfect timing" bonus for well-timed key presses
