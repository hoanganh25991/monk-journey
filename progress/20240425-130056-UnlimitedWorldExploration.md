# Unlimited World Exploration

## Overview
This update removes the movement boundaries from the game, allowing players to explore an infinite world in all directions. Previously, players were confined to the initial terrain mesh, but now they can move freely throughout the entire procedurally generated world.

## Key Changes

1. **Unlimited Movement System**
   - Modified the InputHandler to allow targeting points beyond the initial terrain
   - Added a fallback system using a ground plane when the mouse is outside the terrain mesh
   - Removed all invisible boundaries that previously restricted player movement

2. **Expanded Water Plane**
   - Increased the water plane size from 2000x2000 to 10000x10000 units
   - Ensures water is visible no matter how far the player explores

3. **Consistent Terrain System**
   - The getTerrainHeight method now works consistently across the entire world
   - All objects (trees, rocks, buildings) are properly positioned on the ground

## Technical Implementation

1. Enhanced `InputHandler.js` with:
   - A dual-targeting system that works both on and off the initial terrain
   - A plane-based raycasting system for areas beyond the terrain mesh

2. Modified `World.js` to:
   - Create a much larger water plane that extends far beyond the explorable area
   - Ensure consistent terrain height calculations everywhere

## Gameplay Impact

- Players can now explore the world without artificial boundaries
- The environment, enemies, and objects will continue to generate infinitely
- The game world feels truly open and limitless
- All the previously implemented systems (enemy spawning, environment objects) work seamlessly in the expanded world

## Future Improvements

- Add distant terrain features like mountains on the horizon
- Implement a minimap system to help with navigation in the infinite world
- Create unique landmarks that serve as navigation points
- Add a "return to starting area" feature for players who venture too far
