# Loading Progress Time-Based Implementation

## Overview
This update completely revamps the loading progress indicator to use a time-based approach instead of trying to track actual resource loading. This ensures users see continuous progress during the entire 20-second loading period, rather than seeing no progress and then a sudden jump to 100%.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. No Progress During Large Module Download
- Implemented a time-based progress indicator that shows continuous progress regardless of actual download status
- Set an estimated loading time of 20 seconds based on observed behavior
- Added descriptive messages that change as the progress increases

### 2. Loading Screen to Game Menu Transition
- Fixed issues with the transition from loading screen to game menu
- Added forced repaints to ensure UI updates are properly applied
- Implemented additional checks to ensure the game menu is visible after loading

### 3. Script Loading Order
- Moved the loading progress script to the very beginning of the head section
- Ensures the loading indicator appears as early as possible in the page load process
- Prevents the blank screen during the initial download

## Implementation Details

1. **Time-Based Progress Indicator**:
   - Uses a timer to gradually increase progress over an estimated 20-second period
   - Shows descriptive messages that change as progress increases
   - Provides immediate visual feedback from the moment the page starts loading

2. **Improved Transition Handling**:
   - Changed the order of operations in main.js to create the game menu before hiding the loading screen
   - Added forced repaints using `document.body.offsetHeight` to ensure UI updates are applied
   - Implemented additional checks and timeouts to ensure the game menu becomes visible

3. **Script Positioning**:
   - Moved the loading progress script to the very beginning of the head section
   - Ensures it loads and executes before any other resources are requested
   - Provides immediate feedback to users from the moment the page starts loading

## Benefits

- Users see continuous progress during the entire loading process
- No more blank screen or stuck progress at 0%
- Smooth transition from loading screen to game menu
- Better user experience with descriptive loading messages

## Technical Notes

- Uses `setInterval` to update progress based on elapsed time
- Calculates progress as a percentage of the estimated total loading time
- Implements multiple safety checks to ensure proper cleanup and transitions
- Forces DOM repaints at critical points to ensure UI updates are applied
