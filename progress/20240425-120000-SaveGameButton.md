# Save Game Button Implementation

## Changes Made

1. Added "Save Game" button to the game menu in `index.html`:
   - Added a new button with ID `save-game-button` in the menu-button-container
   - Set initial display to "none" to hide it until appropriate

2. Updated `GameMenu.js` to implement save game functionality:
   - Added reference to the save game button in the constructor
   - Added event listener for the save game button that calls `saveGame(true)` on the SaveManager
   - Added notification handling for successful and failed save attempts
   - Updated the `show()` method to control the visibility of the save game button based on game state

## How It Works

- The save game button is only shown when the game is running and a player exists
- When clicked, it forces an immediate save of the game state
- The save operation uses the existing SaveManager's `saveGame()` method with `forceSave=true`
- Success or failure notifications are shown to the user
- The button is properly integrated with the existing game menu UI

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Start a new game
2. Open the game menu (the Save Game button should now be visible)
3. Click the Save Game button
4. Verify that a success notification appears
5. Close and reopen the game to confirm the save was successful
