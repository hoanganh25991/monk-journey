# Player Class Refactoring

## Overview
The Player class has been refactored to follow a component-based architecture, improving maintainability, readability, and extensibility. The monolithic Player class has been split into multiple specialized components, each with a clear responsibility.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure
Created a new directory structure:
```
js/entities/player/
├── PlayerInterface.js
├── Player.js
├── PlayerStats.js
├── PlayerState.js
├── PlayerInventory.js
├── PlayerModel.js
├── PlayerMovement.js
├── PlayerSkills.js
├── PlayerCombat.js
└── index.js
```

### Component Breakdown
1. **PlayerInterface.js**: Defines interfaces for all player components
2. **Player.js**: Main player class that integrates all components
3. **PlayerStats.js**: Manages player statistics, experience, and leveling
4. **PlayerState.js**: Handles player state (moving, attacking, etc.)
5. **PlayerInventory.js**: Manages inventory and equipment
6. **PlayerModel.js**: Handles the 3D model and animations
7. **PlayerMovement.js**: Controls player movement and camera
8. **PlayerSkills.js**: Manages skills and abilities
9. **PlayerCombat.js**: Handles combat, damage calculations, and effects

### Backward Compatibility
- The original `js/entities/palyer/Player.js` file now re-exports the new Player class, ensuring backward compatibility with existing code.
- All public methods from the original Player class are preserved in the new implementation.

### Benefits
1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Better Organization**: Code is logically grouped by functionality
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand
4. **Easier Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
5. **Simplified Extension**: New features can be added to specific components without affecting others

## Usage
The refactored Player class can be used exactly as before:

```javascript
import { Player } from '../entities/Player.js';

// Create a new player
const player = new Player(scene, camera, loadingManager);
await player.init();
```

For more granular access to components, import from the new structure:

```javascript
import { Player, PlayerStats, PlayerModel } from '../entities/player';
```

## Future Improvements
1. Add unit tests for each component
2. Implement dependency injection for better testability
3. Consider using TypeScript for stronger type checking
4. Add documentation for each component's API
