# Small World with Endless Exploration

## Overview
This update transforms the game world into a smaller initial terrain that seamlessly extends into an infinite procedurally generated world. The entire world now uses the same generation system, making the starting area consistent with the rest of the world. Enemy spawning has been improved to trigger when the player moves a screen's distance.

## Key Changes

1. **Smaller Initial World**
   - Reduced terrain size from 1000 to 100 (1/10 of previous size)
   - Reduced chunk size from 200 to 20 for more frequent updates
   - Adjusted terrain resolution to match the smaller scale

2. **Consistent World Generation**
   - Made the entire world use the same flat terrain system
   - Applied uniform grass coloring with slight variations
   - Created a consistent look between the starting area and the endless world

3. **Screen-Based Enemy Spawning**
   - Enemies now spawn when the player moves a screen's distance (20 units)
   - Enemies appear in groups of 5-9 just outside the player's view
   - Distant enemies are automatically removed to maintain performance

4. **Improved Zone System**
   - Created a grid of zones across the entire world
   - Added randomness to zone positions to avoid a rigid grid pattern
   - Varied zone sizes slightly for more natural boundaries
   - Placed a special Dark Sanctum zone at the center

5. **Extended Water Plane**
   - Created a much larger water plane that extends far beyond the visible terrain
   - Positioned water slightly below the terrain to avoid visual glitches

## Technical Implementation

1. Modified `World.js` to:
   - Use smaller terrain and chunk sizes
   - Track player movement for screen-based spawning
   - Generate zones in a grid pattern across the world
   - Create a consistent flat terrain

2. Enhanced `EnemyManager.js` with:
   - Screen-based enemy spawning system
   - Distance-based enemy cleanup
   - Group-based enemy placement

## Gameplay Impact

- The world feels more consistent with the same look and feel everywhere
- Enemies appear naturally as the player explores
- The world extends infinitely in all directions
- Environmental objects (trees, rocks, bushes, flowers) appear throughout the world
- Zones provide variety in enemy types across different areas

## Future Improvements

- Add terrain variations (hills, valleys) that are consistent across the infinite world
- Implement special landmarks that appear at specific coordinates
- Create biome transitions between different zone types
- Add weather effects that vary by zone
