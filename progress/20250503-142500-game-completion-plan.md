## Verification Plan

To ensure the game is fully complete according to the functional requirements, I'll verify each component against the requirements:

1. **Playground and Map**
   - Verify 3D environment with free navigation
   - Check for terrain features (hills, rivers, structures)
   - Confirm distinct zones for exploration

2. **Player Character**
   - Verify Monk character model and animations
   - Test all Monk abilities (offensive and defensive)
   - Check character stats and progression

3. **Enemies**
   - Verify enemy models and animations
   - Test enemy AI behaviors (attack, defense, movement)
   - Check boss enemies and special abilities

4. **Skills and Combat**
   - Test all Monk skills for visual effects and functionality
   - Verify collision detection for skills and attacks
   - Check damage calculation and combat mechanics

5. **Movement and Controls**
   - Test keyboard and mouse controls for movement
   - Verify camera controls and positioning
   - Check for smooth navigation in the 3D environment

6. **User Interface**
   - Verify health and mana bars functionality
   - Test inventory and equipment screens
   - Check quest log and objective tracking
   - Verify dialog system for interactions

7. **Advanced Requirements**
   - Test RPG system (levels, experience)
   - Verify equipment system functionality
   - Check quest system and storyline progression
   - Test skill tree and upgrades
   - Verify graphics and effects quality

## Completion Tasks

Based on the progress files and code review, the game appears to be functionally complete. However, I'll perform the following tasks to ensure everything is working as expected:

1. **Testing and Verification**
   - Run the game and test all features
   - Verify all requirements are met
   - Check for any bugs or issues

2. **Documentation**
   - Create a final completion report
   - Document any known issues or limitations
   - Provide recommendations for future improvements

3. **Final Build**
   - Ensure all code is properly commented
   - Optimize performance where possible
   - Create a final build of the game

## Conclusion

The Diablo Immortal game appears to be functionally complete with all required features implemented according to the specifications. The game provides a complete RPG experience with character progression, combat, quests, and exploration.

After verification, I'll create a final completion report documenting the status of the game and any recommendations for future improvements.
