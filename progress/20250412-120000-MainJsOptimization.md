# Main.js Optimization Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Code Reorganization**
   - Separated UI components into individual files:
     - LoadingScreen.js
     - GameMenu.js
     - SettingsMenu.js
     - SettingsButton.js
   - Simplified main.js to only handle initialization and coordination

2. **UI Component Encapsulation**
   - Each UI component is now a class with proper encapsulation
   - Components handle their own creation, event handling, and cleanup
   - Improved separation of concerns

3. **CSS Improvements**
   - Created dedicated ui.css file for UI-specific styles
   - Removed inline styles where possible
   - Improved organization of CSS imports

4. **Code Cleanup**
   - Removed duplicate code
   - Improved method naming and organization
   - Added proper documentation

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**
   - Each component can now be modified independently
   - Easier to understand the codebase structure
   - Better separation of concerns

2. **Reusability**
   - UI components can be reused across the application
   - Consistent styling and behavior

3. **Performance**
