# GLTF Model Loading Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented GLTF model loading for the player character in Diablo Immortal. The implementation now loads the "warrior_monk.glb" model from the assets directory and handles its animations. The model is scaled to 1/100 of its original size to fit properly in the game world.

## Changes Made

1. Added GLTFLoader import from Three.js addons
2. Modified the PlayerModel class to support GLTF models:
   - Added properties for the GLTF model, animation mixer, and animations
   - Implemented model loading with error handling and fallback
   - Added animation support with crossfade transitions
   - Updated combat animations to use model animations when available
   - Added model scaling configuration (set to 0.01 or 1/100 of original size)

3. Key features implemented:
   - Asynchronous model loading with progress tracking
   - Automatic shadow casting for all model meshes
   - Animation system with smart fallbacks
   - Smooth animation transitions
   - Intelligent animation name matching
   - Configurable model scaling

4. Fallback system:
   - If the GLTF model fails to load, falls back to the original geometric model
   - If specific animations aren't found, tries similar named animations
   - If no matching animations are found, falls back to the original animation system

## Technical Details

- The model is loaded from `/assets/models/warrior_monk.glb`
- Model is scaled to 1/100 of its original size (scale factor: 0.01)
- Model is rotated 180 degrees around the X-axis to fix upside-down orientation
- Added a `setModelScale(scale)` method to allow dynamic scale adjustment
- Animations are automatically detected from the model
- The system tries to match animation names like "idle", "walk", "run", "attack"
- Combat animations include left punch, right punch, left hook, and heavy punch

## Next Steps

1. Further fine-tune model positioning based on the new scale
2. Add more specific animation mappings
3. Implement additional visual effects for combat
4. Add support for equipment and character customization
