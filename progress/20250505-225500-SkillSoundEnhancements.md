# Skill Sound Enhancements

## Summary
Enhanced the skill sound system to provide more meaningful and descriptive audio feedback for each skill. The improvements include:

1. Added distinct sounds for each phase of skill usage:
   - Cast sounds: When the skill is initially activated
   - Impact sounds: When the skill hits or affects targets
   - End sounds: When the skill effect completes or dissipates

2. Created thematically appropriate sounds for each skill:
   - Water-themed sounds for Wave Strike
   - Wind-themed sounds for Cyclone Strike
   - Rapid striking sounds for Seven-Sided Strike
   - Barrier/protection sounds for Inner Sanctuary
   - Summoning sounds for Mystic Ally
   - Bell sounds for Wave of Light
   - Explosion sounds for Exploding Palm
   - Thunder/lightning sounds for Fist of Thunder

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated Skill Configuration
Modified the `skills.js` file to include more descriptive sound configurations for each skill:
- Added comments to clarify the thematic intent of each sound
- Ensured each skill has appropriate cast, impact, and end sounds where applicable

### 2. Enhanced AudioManager
Updated the `AudioManager.js` file to:
- Organize sounds into logical categories (cast, impact, end)
- Add all new sound effects to both the regular and simulated sound creation methods
- Maintain consistent volume levels appropriate for each sound type

### 3. Updated Audio Generator
Modified the `generate-audio.js` script to:
- Add definitions for all new sound effects
- Configure appropriate audio parameters (frequency, duration, type, etc.) for each sound
- Group sounds by their functional categories

## Technical Details
- Added 16 new sound effects to complement the existing 8 skill cast sounds
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
- Ensured all sounds have appropriate fallbacks for simulated audio when audio files aren't available

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more variation to similar sound types
- Implement volume adjustment based on distance from the player
- Add support for layered/composite sounds for more complex effects
