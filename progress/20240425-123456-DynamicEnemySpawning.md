# Dynamic Enemy Spawning Implementation

## Overview
This update implements dynamic enemy spawning throughout the entire game world. Previously, enemies were only spawned in the center area, but now they will appear in groups as the player explores different regions of the world.

## Key Features
1. **Chunk-Based Enemy Spawning**: Enemies now spawn in the chunks around the player as they move through the world
2. **Enemy Groups**: Enemies spawn in groups of 2-5, making combat more interesting and challenging
3. **Zone-Specific Enemies**: Different types of enemies spawn based on the zone (forest, desert, mountains, etc.)
4. **Dynamic Cleanup**: Enemies that are too far from the player are automatically removed to maintain performance
5. **Extended World Zones**: Added more zones throughout the world with appropriate enemy types

## Technical Implementation
1. Modified `World.js` to:
   - Track the player's current chunk
   - Notify the EnemyManager when the player moves to a new chunk
   - Create additional zones throughout the world

2. Enhanced `EnemyManager.js` with:
   - Chunk-based enemy tracking
   - Methods to spawn enemy groups in specific chunks
   - Cleanup of distant enemies
   - Zone-appropriate enemy selection

3. Updated `Game.js` to:
   - Connect the World and EnemyManager systems
   - Update the world based on player position in each frame

## Gameplay Impact
- The world feels more alive with enemies appearing throughout the entire map
- Combat encounters are more varied with different enemy types in different regions
- Players will encounter groups of enemies rather than individual monsters
- The difficulty scales naturally as players explore further from the starting area

## Future Improvements
- Add more variety to enemy groups (mixed enemy types)
- Implement difficulty scaling based on distance from starting area
- Add special encounters with mini-bosses in distant regions
- Create unique loot tables for different zones
