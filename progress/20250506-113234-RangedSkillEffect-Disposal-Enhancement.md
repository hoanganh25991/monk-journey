# RangedSkillEffect Disposal Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the resource disposal mechanism for the `RangedSkillEffect` class to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup of Three.js resources.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Disposal Triggers**
   - Added explicit calls to `dispose()` when effects expire due to:
     - Duration timeout
     - Maximum range reached

2. **Implemented Missing Methods**
   - Added the `createDefaultRangedEffect` method that was referenced but not implemented
   - This method creates a standard projectile effect with appropriate geometries and materials

3. **Enhanced Disposal Process**
   - Improved the `dispose()` method with more thorough cleanup:
     - Properly disposes of all geometries
     - Properly disposes of all materials
     - Properly disposes of all textures (maps)
     - Clears userData references to prevent memory leaks
     - Removes the effect from its parent
     - Nullifies all references

4. **Improved Reset Functionality**
   - Enhanced the `reset()` method to properly clean up and reset all state variables
   - Ensures the effect can be reused without memory leaks

## Technical Details

- **Texture Disposal**: Added specific handling for various texture types (map, normalMap, specularMap, emissiveMap)
- **Vector3 Cleanup**: Properly nullifies Vector3 objects stored in userData to prevent memory leaks
- **Wave Strike Specific Cleanup**: Added special handling for Wave Strike effect resources
- **Reference Management**: Ensures all references are properly nullified after disposal

## Benefits

- Prevents memory leaks in long-running game sessions
- Improves performance by properly releasing GPU resources
- Ensures consistent behavior when effects are created and destroyed frequently
