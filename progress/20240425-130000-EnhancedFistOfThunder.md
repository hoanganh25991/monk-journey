# Enhanced Fist of Thunder Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the "Fist of Thunder" basic attack to provide a more versatile combat experience. The player can now hold the "h" key to continuously attack, with the system intelligently choosing between teleporting to distant enemies or performing melee punches when enemies are already in close range.

## Changes Made

1. **Added useBasicAttack method to Player.js**
   - Intelligently decides between teleport and punch based on enemy proximity
   - Teleports to distant enemies (beyond 2 units)
   - Performs a punch attack on enemies within melee range (2 units)
   - Reuses the Fist of Thunder skill for both attack types

2. **Added punch animation and effects**
   - Created createPunchAnimation method to animate the player's right arm
   - Implemented createPunchEffect method to show a visual effect for punches
   - Punch effect uses the same blue color as the Fist of Thunder teleport

3. **Updated InputHandler.js**
   - Modified the "h" key handler to use the new useBasicAttack method
   - Added support for holding the "h" key to continuously attack
   - Implemented proper cooldown handling for repeated attacks

## How to Use
- Press and hold the "h" key to continuously attack enemies
- When enemies are far away, the player will teleport to them
- When enemies are already in melee range, the player will punch them
- If no enemies are in range, a notification will be shown

## Technical Details
- Melee range is defined as 2 units
- Teleport range remains at 15 units
- Punch animation rotates the player's right arm forward
- Punch effect creates a blue sphere that expands and fades out
- Both attack types use the same damage, mana cost, and cooldown as the original Fist of Thunder skill
