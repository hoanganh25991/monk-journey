# Save Manager Fix - 2024-04-25

## Issue
After loading a saved game, the following error occurred:
```
Player.js:117 Uncaught TypeError: this.stats.regenerateResources is not a function
    at Player.update (Player.js:117:20)
    at Game.animate (Game.js:312:21)
    at Game.js:289:42
```

## Root Cause
In the `SaveManager.js` file, the `loadPlayerData` method was replacing the player's stats object with a plain JavaScript object from the save data. This plain object had all the properties of the original `PlayerStats` class instance, but it didn't have any of the methods, including the `regenerateResources` method that was being called in the Player's update method.

## Solution
Modified the `loadPlayerData` method to update the properties of the existing `PlayerStats` object instead of replacing it entirely. This preserves all the methods of the class while still loading the saved property values.

Also applied the same fix to the equipment loading to ensure any methods on the equipment object are preserved.

## Changes Made
1. Modified `loadPlayerData` to update properties instead of replacing the stats object:
```javascript
// Instead of replacing the stats object, update its properties
// This preserves the methods of the PlayerStats class
Object.keys(playerData.stats).forEach(key => {
    player.stats[key] = playerData.stats[key];
});
```

2. Modified equipment loading to update properties instead of replacing the object:
```javascript
// Check if player.equipment exists
if (!player.equipment) {
    player.equipment = {};
}
// Update equipment properties instead of replacing the object
Object.keys(playerData.equipment).forEach(key => {
    player.equipment[key] = playerData.equipment[key];
});
```

## Testing
The fix should be tested by:
1. Creating a save game
2. Loading the save game
3. Verifying that no errors occur during gameplay
4. Checking that player stats and equipment are correctly loaded
