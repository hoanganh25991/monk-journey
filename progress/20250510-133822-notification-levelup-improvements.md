# Notification and Level Up System Improvements

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Reduced Notification Duration
- Changed notification lifetime from dynamic (1.5-2.5s) to a fixed shorter duration of 0.7s
- This makes notifications appear and disappear more quickly, creating a more responsive feel

### 2. Level Up Animation Improvements
- Moved level up animation from dynamic JavaScript DOM creation to static HTML/CSS
- Added dedicated HTML structure in index.html for the level up animation
- Created CSS animations for the level up effect with a 0.7s duration
- Level up notifications now bypass the regular notification queue for immediate display

### 3. CSS Styling Enhancements
- Added new CSS classes and keyframe animations for the level up effect
- Improved visual hierarchy with proper z-index values
- Created a clean animation that scales and fades for a polished effect

## Files Modified

1. `/js/core/hud-manager/NotificationsUI.js`
   - Updated notification lifetime to 0.7s
   - Refactored `showLevelUp()` method to use HTML elements instead of dynamic creation
   - Modified level up notification to bypass the queue

2. `/index.html`
   - Added new HTML structure for level up animation:
   ```html
   <div id="level-up-container" class="hidden">
       <div class="level-up-content">
           <span class="level-up-text">Level Up!</span>
           <span class="level-up-level"></span>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

3. `/css/core/notifications.css`
   - Added new CSS classes for level up animation
   - Created keyframe animation for the level up effect
   - Set proper positioning and styling for the level up elements

## Benefits

- **Performance**: Reduced DOM manipulation by using pre-defined HTML elements
- **Consistency**: Level up animations now have a consistent appearance and timing
- **Responsiveness**: Shorter notification duration improves the game's responsiveness
- **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns with HTML structure, CSS styling, and JS behavior
