# SaveManager Fix - 2025-05-07

## Issue
The game's save and load functionality was broken due to structural changes in the codebase. The SaveManager.js file was trying to access properties and methods that had been moved or renamed, causing errors when trying to load saved games.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed the `loadWorldData` method
- Updated references to world.zones to use world.zoneManager.zones
- Updated references to world.interactiveObjects to use world.interactiveManager.objects
- Updated references to world.terrainChunks to use world.terrainManager.terrainChunks
- Added proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues

### 2. Fixed the `loadPlayerData` method
- Added robust error handling
- Added null checks for player properties
- Added fallbacks for missing data

### 3. Fixed the `loadQuestData` method
- Added error handling
- Added null checks for quest manager properties
- Added fallbacks for missing data

### 4. Updated the `InputHandler.js` file
- Added fallbacks for the new interactive objects structure
- Added warning logs when using legacy structures

## Results
The game can now properly save and load game data, maintaining compatibility with both the new structure (using managers) and the old structure (direct properties on the world object).
