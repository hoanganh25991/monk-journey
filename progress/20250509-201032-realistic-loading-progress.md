# Realistic Loading Progress Implementation

## Overview
This update enhances the loading progress indicator to provide a more realistic experience based on actual file sizes that need to be downloaded. Instead of using a time-based estimation, the progress now reflects the actual download progress of different file categories, making the loading experience more accurate and informative.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `initial-load-progress.js`
- Implemented file-size based progress tracking that uses actual file sizes from the service worker
- Added functionality to fetch and parse file size data from the service worker
- Categorized files by type (models, images, audio, JavaScript, CSS, etc.) for more realistic loading simulation
- Simulated different loading speeds for different file types to mimic real-world network behavior
- Added detailed progress information including loaded bytes and total size
- Implemented a fallback to the original time-based progress if file size data cannot be retrieved

### 2. Key Features Added
- **File Size Extraction**: Extracts file size information from the service worker to determine total download size
- **Categorized Loading**: Groups files by type and loads them in a logical order (core files first, then JS/CSS, then media)
- **Realistic Speed Simulation**: Simulates different download speeds for different file types
- **Detailed Progress Information**: Shows both percentage and actual size information (e.g., "5.2MB / 9.9MB")
- **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to time-based estimation if file size data is unavailable

### 3. Technical Implementation Details
- Uses a promise-based approach to fetch file size data
- Parses the `FILE_SIZES` object from the service worker
- Categorizes files based on file extensions
- Simulates network loading with different speeds per file category:
  - Core Files: 500KB/s
  - JavaScript: 300KB/s
  - Stylesheets: 400KB/s
  - Images: 200KB/s
  - Audio: 150KB/s
  - 3D Models: 100KB/s
- Updates the loading bar and status text with detailed information about the current file being loaded

## Benefits
1. **More Accurate Progress**: Users see a progress indicator that reflects actual download progress
2. **Better User Experience**: Detailed information about what's being loaded provides context
3. **Realistic Expectations**: File size information helps users understand how much data is being downloaded
4. **Improved Reliability**: Fallback mechanism ensures progress works even if file size data is unavailable

## Testing Notes
- The implementation works with the existing `LoadingScreen` class without requiring changes to it
- If the service worker is not available or doesn't contain file size information, the system falls back to the original time-based progress
- The progress indicator now shows both percentage and actual size information for better context

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing actual download progress tracking using fetch with progress events
- Add network speed detection to adjust simulated download speeds based on user's connection
- Implement a more sophisticated caching strategy to skip already cached files in the progress calculation
