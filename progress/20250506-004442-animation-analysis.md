# Animation Analysis for Chinese Warrior Monk Model

## Current Implementation

1. The `updateAnimations` method in PlayerModel.js is being called correctly in the game loop:
   - Called from Player.js's update method
   - Receives the delta time and player state as parameters

2. Animation setup for GLB models:
   - The code loads animations from the GLB file
   - Sets up an animation mixer
   - Stores animations by name for easy access
   - Attempts to play the 'idle' animation by default, or falls back to the first available animation

3. Animation playback based on player state:
   - Plays 'walk' or 'run' animations when the player is moving
   - Plays 'attack' or 'punch' animations when the player is attacking
   - Plays 'idle' animation when the player is stationary

## Potential Issues

1. **Animation Names**: The new Chinese Warrior Monk model might have different animation names than the previous model. The code has fallback mechanisms to find similar animations, but it might not find exact matches.

2. **Model Scale**: The model scale has been updated from 0.05 to 1.2, which might be appropriate for the new model, but could need further adjustment.

3. **Animation Timing**: The new model's animations might have different timing or durations, which could affect how they look in-game.

## Recommendations

1. **Check Animation Names**: Run the game and check the console log for "Available animations:" to see what animations are included in the new model. Update the animation names in the code if needed.

2. **Adjust Model Scale**: Test the game with the current scale (1.2) and adjust if the model appears too large or too small.

3. **Test Animation Transitions**: Verify that transitions between animations (idle to walk, walk to attack, etc.) work smoothly with the new model.

4. **Add Debug Logging**: Consider adding temporary debug logging to track which animations are being played and when.

## Next Steps

1. Test the game with the new model to see if animations are working correctly
2. Make any necessary adjustments to animation names or parameters
3. Fine-tune the model scale if needed
