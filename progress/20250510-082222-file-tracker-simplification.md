# File Tracker UI Setup Simplification

## Overview
Simplified the UI element setup in the file tracker to use a more direct approach. Removed complex DOM readiness checks and element retry logic in favor of a simpler, more reliable implementation.

## Changes Made

### Simplified UI Setup
- Replaced the complex `setupExistingUI()` and `getUIElements()` functions with a single `setupUI()` function
- Eliminated DOM readiness checks and element retry logic
- Added a return value to indicate whether UI setup was successful

### Improved Error Handling
- Added clear error messaging when UI elements cannot be found
- Prevented further initialization when UI elements are missing
- Eliminated unnecessary retry attempts that could lead to unpredictable behavior

### More Reliable Initialization
- Made initialization conditional on successful UI setup
- Ensured that network observation and file tracking only start when UI is ready
- Improved code readability and maintainability

## Benefits

### Improved Reliability
- Eliminated potential race conditions in UI element detection
- Reduced complexity in the initialization process
- Provided clearer feedback when elements are missing

### Better Error Handling
- Added explicit error messaging instead of warnings
- Prevented partial initialization when UI elements are missing
- Made the system fail gracefully when required elements aren't available

### Simplified Code
- Reduced the number of functions needed for UI setup
- Eliminated unnecessary setTimeout calls and retry logic
- Improved code readability and maintainability

## Implementation Details

The new implementation uses a single `setupUI()` function that:
1. Attempts to find all required UI elements
2. Returns `false` if any elements are missing, with a clear error message
3. Returns `true` if all elements are found, allowing initialization to proceed

This approach is more direct and reliable than the previous implementation, which used complex DOM readiness checks and element retry logic.

The main `initTracking()` function now only proceeds with initialization if UI setup is successful, preventing partial initialization when UI elements are missing.

This simplification makes the code more reliable and easier to maintain, while still providing the same functionality as before.
