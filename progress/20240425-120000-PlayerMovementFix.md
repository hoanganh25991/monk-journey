# Player Movement Fix

## Issue
The hero character in the game was not moving when pressing movement buttons, even though the screen was updating and enemies were moving toward new locations.

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the code, I identified that there was a synchronization issue between the player's movement component and the model component. The movement component was updating its internal position, but this wasn't being properly reflected in the model's position in the 3D scene.

## Changes Made

1. Added explicit position and rotation synchronization in the Player.js update method:
   ```javascript
   // Sync model position with movement position
   const currentPosition = this.movement.getPosition();
   this.model.setPosition(currentPosition);
   
   // Sync model rotation with movement rotation
   const currentRotation = this.movement.getRotation();
   this.model.setRotation(currentRotation);
   ```

2. Enhanced logging in the PlayerModel.js setPosition and setRotation methods to help with debugging:
   ```javascript
   if (this.modelGroup) {
       this.modelGroup.position.copy(position);
       console.log("PlayerModel: Position updated to:", this.modelGroup.position);
   }
   ```

3. Added additional logging in the Player.js init method to confirm the model group is properly initialized:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Player initialized with model group:", this.model.getModelGroup());
   ```

## Expected Outcome
The hero character should now move correctly when pressing movement buttons (W, A, S, D or arrow keys). The model's position and rotation will be explicitly synchronized with the movement component's values in each update cycle.

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Start the game
2. Press movement keys (W, A, S, D or arrow keys)
3. Verify that the hero character moves in the expected direction
4. Verify that the hero character's rotation updates to face the direction of movement
