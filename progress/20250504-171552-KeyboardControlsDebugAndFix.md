# Keyboard Controls Debug and Fix

## Overview
Fixed issues with alternative keyboard controls and moved inventory toggle from "i" to "y" key to avoid conflicts with skill keys.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Alternative Key Handling
- Added extensive debug logging to track key presses and skill usage
- Consolidated the handling of alternative keys (j,k,l,;,u,i,o) to ensure consistent behavior
- Fixed issues with key state tracking for alternative keys

### 2. Moved Inventory Toggle from "i" to "y"
- Changed the inventory toggle key from "i" to "y"
- Made "i" key exclusively a skill key (mapped to Digit6)
- Added clear logging for inventory toggle action

### 3. Enhanced Continuous Casting Logic
- Improved the update method to better handle alternative keys
- Added additional safety checks for key mapping
- Added detailed logging for continuous casting to aid in debugging

### 4. Improved Player Skill Usage Feedback
- Added comprehensive logging to the Player.useSkill method
- Added validation checks with clear error messages
- Improved feedback for skill cooldown and mana requirements

## Benefits
- More reliable keyboard controls for skills
- Better separation between UI controls and skill controls
- Improved debugging capabilities for future issues
- Consistent behavior across all alternative key mappings

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- All alternative keys correctly trigger their corresponding skills
- The "y" key properly toggles the inventory
- Continuous casting works correctly when holding alternative keys
- Debug logging provides clear information about key presses and skill usage
