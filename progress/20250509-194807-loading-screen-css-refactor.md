# Loading Screen CSS Refactoring

## Summary
Refactored the loading screen text elements to use external CSS instead of inline styles. This improves code maintainability and separation of concerns.

## Changes Made
1. Removed inline styling for `#loading-text` and `#loading-info` elements in `LoadingScreen.js`
2. Added proper error handling when elements are not found
3. Added CSS definitions for these elements in `menu-system.css`

## Files Modified
- `/js/core/menu-system/LoadingScreen.js`
- `/css/core/menu-system.css`

## Technical Details
- Removed dynamic creation of elements in JavaScript
- Added console.error messages when elements are not found
- Moved all styling to CSS file for better maintainability
- Preserved the exact same styling values for consistency

## Benefits
- Better separation of concerns (HTML structure, CSS styling, JS behavior)
- Improved maintainability
- Consistent styling across the application
- Better error reporting when elements are missing
