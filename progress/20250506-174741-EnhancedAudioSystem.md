# Enhanced Audio System with Complex Frequencies

## Summary
Completely overhauled the audio generation system to create more realistic and immersive sound effects for all skills. The new system uses complex frequency combinations, harmonics, and advanced audio processing techniques to create sounds that better match their elemental nature while keeping durations short for responsive gameplay.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Multi-Frequency Sound Generation
- Replaced single-frequency sounds with complex multi-frequency harmonics
- Each skill now has 2-7 frequency components that blend together
- Created natural harmonic relationships between frequencies (e.g., fundamental + octave + fifth)
- Implemented frequency ratios based on the golden ratio for light-based skills

### 2. Advanced Audio Effects
- **Noise Components**: Added controlled noise to create realistic water splashes, wind, and thunder static
- **Filters**: Applied lowpass, highpass, and bandpass filters to shape the sound spectrum
- **Distortion**: Added configurable distortion for explosive and thunder sounds
- **Attack/Decay Envelopes**: Implemented precise control over sound attack and decay phases
- **Vibrato & Tremolo**: Added modulation effects for wind and thunder sounds
- **Reverb & Echo**: Enhanced spatial qualities for bell, sanctuary, and thunder sounds

### 3. Element-Specific Sound Design
- **Water Skills**: Smooth sine waves with subtle noise and lowpass filtering
- **Wind Skills**: Sawtooth waves with vibrato, tremolo, and bandpass filtering
- **Thunder Skills**: High frequencies with noise, distortion, and highpass filtering
- **Physical Skills**: Sharp attack phases with precise timing for impact sounds
- **Protective Skills**: Harmonic chords with reverb for spatial presence
- **Bell/Light Skills**: Complex harmonic series with long decay and reverb
- **Explosion Effects**: Combination of fundamental frequencies with sub-bass components

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Audio Generation Script (`scripts/generate-audio.js`)
- Completely redesigned sound definitions with detailed parameters
- Created specialized functions for multi-frequency sound generation
- Implemented advanced SoX command generation for complex audio processing
- Added support for mixing multiple audio components with proper amplitude scaling

### 2. In-Game Audio System (`js/core/AudioManager.js`)
- Enhanced the simulated sound generation for runtime audio synthesis
- Added support for multi-frequency sound generation in the Web Audio API
- Implemented advanced waveform generation with precise control over harmonics
- Created specialized audio processing for each skill type

## Benefits
1. **More Immersive Experience**: Sounds now match their visual and thematic elements
2. **Better Skill Recognition**: Each skill has a distinctive audio signature
3. **Enhanced Feedback**: More realistic audio cues for player actions
4. **Maintained Performance**: All sounds remain short in duration for responsive gameplay

This enhancement significantly improves the audio experience while maintaining the game's performance characteristics, creating a more immersive and satisfying gameplay experience.
