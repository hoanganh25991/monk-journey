# Key E Interaction Fix

## Issue
Pressing the "E" key was not properly triggering interactions with quest markers and other interactive objects in the game.

## Root Cause
The `interact()` method in the Player class was only setting a state flag (`isInteracting`) but wasn't actually performing any interaction with nearby objects. The method lacked the functionality to:

1. Find nearby interactive objects
2. Interact with the closest one
3. Process the interaction result

## Solution
Enhanced the `interact()` method in the Player class to:

1. Get the player's current position
2. Find all interactive objects within a specified radius (5 units)
3. Sort them by distance to the player
4. Interact with the closest object
5. Process the interaction result based on its type (item, quest, boss_spawn)
6. Show appropriate notifications to the player
7. Reset the interaction state after a short delay

## Testing
The fix should now allow players to:
- Press "E" to interact with nearby quest markers
- Receive quest information and start quests
- Interact with treasure chests and other interactive objects
- See appropriate notifications when nothing is nearby to interact with

## Additional Notes
The interaction system now uses a proximity-based approach rather than requiring precise targeting with the mouse cursor, making it more user-friendly and consistent with the "E" key interaction pattern common in many games.
