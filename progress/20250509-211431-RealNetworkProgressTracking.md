# Real Network Progress Tracking Implementation

## Summary
Implemented a real network progress tracking system to replace the simulated loading progress in the game. The new system uses the Performance Observer API to monitor actual network requests and updates the loading progress based on real download activity.

## Changes Made

### Modified `trackProgressWithFileSize()` function in `pwa/initial-load-progress.js`:

1. **Replaced simulation-based approach with real network monitoring:**
   - Implemented `PerformanceObserver` to track actual resource downloads
   - Calculates progress based on actual downloaded bytes vs. total expected size
   - Maintains backward compatibility with browsers that don't support `PerformanceObserver`

2. **Key improvements:**
   - Progress now reflects actual download activity instead of simulated speeds
   - More accurate reporting of which files are currently being downloaded
   - Better handling of cached resources
   - Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms

3. **Technical implementation details:**
   - Uses `entry.transferSize` to get actual downloaded bytes
   - Maps network URLs to file paths in the file-sizes.json data
   - Updates progress display in real-time as resources are downloaded
   - Provides fallback to interval-based updates for browsers without Performance API support

## Benefits

1. **More accurate loading progress:**
   - Users see real download progress instead of a simulation
   - Progress reflects actual network conditions and download speeds
   - Better user experience with accurate loading information

2. **Better debugging and monitoring:**
   - Console logs show actual download progress
   - Easier to identify slow-loading resources
   - More transparent loading process

3. **Improved reliability:**
   - Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure progress is always shown
   - Safety timeout ensures loading screen doesn't block the game indefinitely

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more detailed network statistics for debugging
2. Implement bandwidth throttling detection to provide feedback on slow connections
3. Add analytics to track loading performance across different devices and network conditions

## Technical Notes

The implementation uses the Performance Observer API, which is supported in all modern browsers. For older browsers, a fallback mechanism using setInterval provides a degraded but functional experience.
