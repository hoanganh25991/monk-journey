# Skeleton King Model Animation Fix

## Issue
The Skeleton King character model was animated in the model-viewer but not in the actual game. This was due to differences in how animations were being detected and played between the two systems.

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the code, I identified several issues:

1. The PlayerModel.js file was using a generic animation detection system that worked well for models with standard animation names (idle, walk, attack) but didn't properly handle models with custom animation names.

2. The Skeleton King model likely has animations with non-standard names that weren't being detected by the existing animation system.

3. There was insufficient logging to debug which animations were available and which were being selected for playback.

## Changes Made

1. Added special handling for the Skeleton King model:
   ```javascript
   // Special handling for skeleton-king model
   if (this.currentModelId === 'skeleton') {
       console.log('Applying special animation handling for Skeleton King model');
       
       // For skeleton model, we'll try to find animations with specific patterns
       const idleAnimations = Object.keys(this.animations).filter(name => 
           name.toLowerCase().includes('idle') || 
           name.toLowerCase().includes('stand') ||
           name.toLowerCase().includes('pose')
       );
       
       if (idleAnimations.length > 0) {
           // Play the first matching idle animation
           this.animations[idleAnimations[0]].play();
           this.currentAnimation = idleAnimations[0];
       }
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. Enhanced the updateAnimations method to handle different animation states for the Skeleton King:
   ```javascript
   // Special handling for skeleton model
   if (this.currentModelId === 'skeleton') {
       if (playerState.isMoving()) {
           // Try to find and play a walk/run animation for skeleton
           const walkAnimations = Object.keys(this.animations).filter(name => 
               name.toLowerCase().includes('walk') || 
               name.toLowerCase().includes('run') ||
               name.toLowerCase().includes('move')
           );
           
           if (walkAnimations.length > 0) {
               this.playAnimation(walkAnimations[0], null, 0.3);
           }
       }
       // ...
   }
   ```

3. Improved the playAnimation method to better handle direct animation names and provide more detailed logging:
   ```javascript
   // Check if primaryName is a direct animation name (for skeleton model)
   if (primaryName && this.animations[primaryName]) {
       animationToPlay = this.animations[primaryName];
       console.log(`Found direct animation match: ${primaryName}`);
   }
   ```

4. Added comprehensive logging throughout the animation system to help with debugging:
   ```javascript
   console.log(`Model ${this.currentModelId} has ${gltf.animations.length} animations:`, Object.keys(this.animations));
   
   gltf.animations.forEach((clip) => {
       this.animations[clip.name] = this.mixer.clipAction(clip);
       console.log(`Found animation: ${clip.name}, duration: ${clip.duration}s`);
   });
   ```

## Expected Outcome
The Skeleton King character model should now be properly animated in the game, with:
- Idle animations when standing still
- Walking/running animations when moving
- Attack animations when attacking

The system now intelligently searches for animations based on common naming patterns, making it more robust for models with non-standard animation names.

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Select the Skeleton King character model in the game
2. Verify that the model is animated when standing still (idle animation)
3. Move the character and verify that a walking/running animation plays
4. Attack with the character and verify that an attack animation plays
