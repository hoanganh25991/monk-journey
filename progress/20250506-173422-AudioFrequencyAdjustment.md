# Audio Frequency Adjustment for Skill Sounds

## Summary
Adjusted the frequencies of skill sounds to better match their elemental nature and characteristics. This ensures that thunder-related skills have higher frequencies than water-related ones, creating a more intuitive audio experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Skill Cast Sounds
- **Wave Strike**: Kept at 280 Hz (water-based, medium frequency)
- **Cyclone Strike**: Increased from 320 Hz to 350 Hz (wind-based)
- **Seven-Sided Strike**: Kept at 380 Hz (physical attack)
- **Inner Sanctuary**: Kept at 180 Hz (protective, low frequency)
- **Fist of Thunder**: Increased from 440 Hz to 520 Hz (thunder-based)
- **Mystic Ally**: Kept at 260 Hz (spiritual)
- **Wave of Light**: Increased from 220 Hz to 420 Hz (light-based)
- **Exploding Palm**: Increased from 300 Hz to 340 Hz (explosive)

### 2. Updated Skill Impact Sounds
- **Water Impact**: Kept at 350 Hz
- **Wind Pull**: Increased from 290 Hz to 330 Hz
- **Rapid Strike**: Kept at 420 Hz
- **Barrier Form**: Kept at 200 Hz
- **Ally Summon**: Kept at 280 Hz
- **Bell Ring**: Kept at 600 Hz
- **Mark Applied**: Kept at 320 Hz
- **Thunder Strike**: Increased from 480 Hz to 550 Hz

### 3. Updated Skill End Sounds
- **Water Dissipate**: Kept at 240 Hz
- **Wind Dissipate**: Increased from 260 Hz to 300 Hz
- **Strike Complete**: Kept at 400 Hz
- **Barrier Dissipate**: Kept at 160 Hz
- **Ally Dismiss**: Kept at 220 Hz
- **Bell Fade**: Kept at 500 Hz
- **Massive Explosion**: Increased from 120 Hz to 220 Hz
- **Thunder Echo**: Increased from 380 Hz to 450 Hz

## Files Modified
1. `/scripts/generate-audio.js` - Updated frequency values in sound definitions
2. `/js/core/AudioManager.js` - Updated frequency values in createSimulatedSound calls

## Rationale
- **Thunder/Lightning Skills**: Higher frequencies (450-550 Hz) to match the crackling, high-pitched nature of lightning
- **Water/Wave Skills**: Medium-low frequencies (240-350 Hz) to match the flowing, softer nature of water
- **Wind/Air Skills**: Medium-high frequencies (300-350 Hz) to match the whooshing nature of wind
- **Explosive Skills**: Increased the frequency of massive explosion to better represent the sharp initial blast
- **Protective/Spiritual Skills**: Kept lower, calming frequencies (160-280 Hz)
- **Bell/Resonant Skills**: Kept higher frequencies with reverb (500-600 Hz)

These changes create a more cohesive and intuitive audio experience that better matches the visual and thematic elements of each skill.
