# Seven-Sided Strike Debug and Fix

## Issue
The Seven-Sided Strike skill was not showing up properly after the enhancement changes. The skill effect was being created but nothing was visible in the game.

## Investigation
After analyzing the code, several potential issues were identified:

1. Missing initialization of `elapsedTime` in the `create` method
2. Potential issues with the vortex rotation and userData
3. Lack of error handling and debugging information
4. Potential issues with monk clone creation

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Added Debug Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging to the `create` method
   - Added logging to the `update` method
   - Added logging for vortex creation and rotation
   - Added error handling for monk clone creation

2. **Fixed Initialization Issues**:
   - Explicitly reset `elapsedTime` to 0 in the `create` method
   - Added fallback color for vortex if skill color is undefined
   - Added additional identification properties to userData

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added try-catch block around monk clone creation
   - Added null checks for the monkTemplate
   - Added validation for the vortex userData

4. **Improved Vortex Rotation**:
   - Added checks to ensure vortex and its userData exist
   - Added fallback for rotationSpeed if it's undefined
   - Added additional logging for vortex rotation

## Technical Changes

1. Modified `create` method to reset `elapsedTime` and add logging
2. Enhanced vortex creation with better error handling and fallbacks
3. Added try-catch block around monk clone creation
4. Added additional checks and logging throughout the update process

## Result

The Seven-Sided Strike skill should now properly display all visual elements:
- The central vortex
- The monk clones appearing at strike points
- The connecting lines between the center and strike points
- The flash effects at strike points

The enhanced debugging information will also make it easier to identify any remaining issues.
