# Performance Optimization Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified FPS Display
- Removed custom FPS display in favor of the built-in Stats.js display
- Stats.js provides a cleaner, more professional FPS counter in the top-right corner
- Reduced UI clutter by having only one performance indicator

### 2. Improved Automatic Quality Adjustment
- Set default quality to "high" for optimal initial experience
- Added user notifications when quality is automatically adjusted
- Notifications explain when quality is lowered and inform users they can adjust settings manually
- Only show notifications for significant quality changes to avoid spamming the user

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- When FPS drops below target, the system automatically lowers quality settings
- Users are informed about quality changes with clear, non-intrusive notifications
- Notifications include guidance on how to manually adjust settings if desired
- System prioritizes maintaining target FPS (60 FPS) for smooth gameplay

### 4. Technical Improvements
- Optimized notification system to use the game's existing UI manager when available
- Fallback notification system for when UI manager is not initialized
- Improved logging of performance adjustments for debugging
- Cleaner code structure with removed redundant elements

## Benefits
- Cleaner UI with less visual clutter

- Smoother initial experience with high quality default settings

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a brief tutorial about performance settings on first run
