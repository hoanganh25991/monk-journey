# Loading Progress Implementation - Bug Fixes

## Overview
This update fixes issues with the loading progress implementation where the loading screen would get stuck at "Loading complete" and not transition properly to the game menu.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Loading Screen Not Hiding Properly
- Fixed an issue where the loading screen wasn't properly hiding after completion
- Removed the delay in hiding the loading screen that was causing it to get stuck
- Added additional checks to ensure the loading screen is actually hidden

### 2. Initial Loading Indicator Interference
- Added safety mechanisms to ensure the initial loading indicator is properly removed
- Implemented a fallback timeout to remove the initial indicator after 15 seconds
- Added checks to detect and remove the initial indicator when the game loading screen appears

### 3. Game Menu Not Showing
- Added debugging to track the game menu display process
- Ensured the game menu is hidden during loading
- Added a small delay before showing the game menu to ensure DOM updates have completed

## Implementation Details

1. **LoadingScreen.js**:
   - Improved the `hide()` method to ensure the loading screen is properly hidden
   - Enhanced the `show()` method to properly handle the initial loading indicator
   - Added additional logging for debugging purposes

2. **initial-load-progress.js**:
   - Added safety mechanisms to ensure the initial loading indicator doesn't interfere with the game
   - Implemented a check to detect when the game's loading screen appears
   - Added a fallback timeout to remove the initial indicator after 15 seconds

3. **main.js**:
   - Added a small delay before showing the game menu to ensure DOM updates have completed
   - Added additional logging to track the transition from loading to game menu
   - Verified the game menu element is properly displayed

## Benefits

- Smooth transition from initial loading to game loading to game menu
- No more stuck loading screens
- Better user experience with clear progress indication throughout the loading process

## Technical Notes

- Used `window.getComputedStyle()` to check actual display state
- Added multiple safety checks to ensure proper cleanup
- Implemented detailed logging for easier debugging
