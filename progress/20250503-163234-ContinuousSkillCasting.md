# Continuous Skill Casting Enhancement

## Changes Made

1. **Continuous Skill Casting When Holding Keys**
   - Modified the `InputHandler` class to track which skill keys are being held down
   - Added a cooldown system for continuous casting to control the rate of skill usage
   - Implemented an update method in the `InputHandler` class that checks for held keys and casts skills at regular intervals
   - Updated the game loop to call the `InputHandler.update()` method

2. **Fixed Issue with Keys 5, 6, and 7**
   - The issue was that the code was correctly detecting the key presses but not properly handling the skill indices
   - Ensured that all digit keys (1-7) are properly tracked in the `skillKeysHeld` object
   - Verified that the skill index calculation works correctly for all keys

## Technical Implementation

1. **Added Key Tracking Properties to InputHandler**
   ```javascript
   // Track skill keys being held down
   this.skillKeysHeld = {
       Digit1: false,
       Digit2: false,
       Digit3: false,
       Digit4: false,
       Digit5: false,
       Digit6: false,
       Digit7: false
   };
   
   // Cooldown tracking for continuous casting
   this.skillCastCooldowns = {
       Digit1: 0,
       Digit2: 0,
       Digit3: 0,
       Digit4: 0,
       Digit5: 0,
       Digit6: 0,
       Digit7: 0
   };
   ```

2. **Updated Key Event Handlers**
   ```javascript
   // On key down
   this.skillKeysHeld[event.code] = true;
   
   // On key up
   if (this.skillKeysHeld[event.code] !== undefined) {
       this.skillKeysHeld[event.code] = false;
       this.skillCastCooldowns[event.code] = 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Added Continuous Casting Logic**
   ```javascript
   update(delta) {
       // Handle continuous skill casting for held keys
       const castInterval = 0.1; // Cast every 0.1 seconds when key is held
       
       for (const keyCode in this.skillKeysHeld) {
           if (this.skillKeysHeld[keyCode]) {
               // Reduce cooldown
               this.skillCastCooldowns[keyCode] -= delta;
               
               // If cooldown is up, cast the skill again
               if (this.skillCastCooldowns[keyCode] <= 0) {
                   const skillIndex = parseInt(keyCode.charAt(5)) - 1;
                   this.game.player.useSkill(skillIndex);
                   
                   // Reset cooldown
                   this.skillCastCooldowns[keyCode] = castInterval;
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Updated Game Loop**
   ```javascript
   // Update input handler for continuous skill casting
   this.inputHandler.update(delta);
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Combat Experience**
   - Players can now hold down skill keys for continuous casting
   - Reduces the need for rapid key tapping during intense combat
   - Makes certain skills (like area-of-effect or channeled abilities) more effective

2. **Fixed Functionality for All Skill Keys**
   - All seven skill keys (1-7) now work correctly
   - Players have access to their full skill set

3. **Customizable Casting Rate**
   - The casting interval can be easily adjusted by changing the `castInterval` value
   - Currently set to 0.1 seconds for responsive but controlled casting
