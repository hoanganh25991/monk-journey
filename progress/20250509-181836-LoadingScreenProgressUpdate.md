# Loading Screen Progress Update

## Task Completed
Added a simple progress tracking feature to the loading screen that increases by 3% every 500ms when no external progress indicator is available.

## Changes Made

1. **Added new properties to LoadingScreen class:**
   - `useSimpleProgress` flag to determine which progress tracking method to use
   - `progressIncrement` to control the percentage increment (default: 3%)

2. **Added new method `trackSimpleProgress()`:**
   - Implements a simple timer that increases progress by 3% every 500ms
   - Caps progress at 99% to allow for final completion signal
   - Updates UI elements with current progress

3. **Modified `show()` method:**
   - Added optional parameter `useSimpleProgress` to choose tracking method
   - Added conditional logic to use either simple or resource-based tracking

4. **Enhanced `updateProgress()` method:**
   - Added logic to switch from simple to manual mode if external updates are received
   - Ensures smooth transition between tracking methods

5. **Added `setProgressIncrement()` method:**
   - Allows customization of the increment percentage

## Usage

To use the simple progress tracking (3% every 500ms):

```javascript
// Initialize and show loading screen with simple progress tracking
const loadingScreen = new LoadingScreen();
loadingScreen.show(true);

// Optional: customize the increment percentage
loadingScreen.setProgressIncrement(5); // 5% every 500ms
```

To use the original resource-based tracking:

```javascript
// Initialize and show loading screen with resource-based tracking (default)
const loadingScreen = new LoadingScreen();
loadingScreen.show();
```

## Benefits

- Provides a fallback progress indicator when actual loading progress can't be determined
- Creates a smoother user experience with continuous progress feedback
- Automatically switches to manual mode if external progress updates are received
- Fully customizable increment rate
