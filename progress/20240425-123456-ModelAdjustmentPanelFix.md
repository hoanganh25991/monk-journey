# Model Adjustment Panel Fix

## Issue
The model adjustment panel was not displaying properly. Only the "Adjust Model" button was visible, possibly due to scrolling issues with the settings panel.

## Changes Made
1. Changed panel positioning from `absolute` to `fixed` to ensure it stays in view regardless of scrolling
2. Moved the panel down to avoid overlap with the toggle button
3. Added a maximum height and scrolling capability to handle overflow content
4. Created a separate content container for scrollable content
5. Made the header sticky so it remains visible when scrolling
6. Improved visual styling:
   - Added shadows for better visibility
   - Used a slightly darker background
   - Added section backgrounds for better organization
   - Improved slider controls with reset buttons
   - Added color coding for different sections
7. Fixed number formatting to display values with 2 decimal places
8. Added null checks to prevent errors when model data is missing
9. Added the model name to the panel title for better context

## Technical Details
- Used CSS `position: fixed` to keep the panel in the viewport
- Added `maxHeight: 80vh` and `overflowY: auto` for scrolling
- Created a sticky header with `position: sticky`
- Added a content container for better organization
- Improved the slider controls with reset buttons and better formatting
- Fixed the `updateModelAdjustmentPanel` method to properly update all values

## Result
The model adjustment panel now displays properly with all controls visible and accessible. The panel has improved usability with:
- Better organization of controls
- Scrolling capability for many controls
- Sticky header that remains visible
- Reset buttons for each control
- Improved visual styling
