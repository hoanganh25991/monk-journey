# Keyboard Movement Implementation

## Overview
Implemented WASD keyboard movement controls to allow players to move their character using the keyboard in addition to mouse clicks.

## Changes Made
1. Added a new `handleKeyboardMovement` method to the `Player` class that:
   - Gets movement direction from the `InputHandler`
   - Calculates new position based on movement speed and delta time
   - Updates player position and rotation
   - Sets the player's target position to the current position to prevent conflicts with mouse movement

2. Modified the `update` method in the `Player` class to call the new `handleKeyboardMovement` method

## Technical Details
- The implementation uses the existing `getMovementDirection` method in the `InputHandler` class, which already checks for WASD key presses
- Movement speed is consistent with the player's defined movement speed stat
- Player rotation is updated to face the direction of movement
- The implementation works alongside the existing mouse-based movement system

## Testing
- Verified that the player can move using the WASD keys
- Confirmed that the player rotates to face the direction of movement
- Tested that mouse movement still works as expected

## Future Improvements
- Add diagonal movement smoothing
- Implement sprint/dash functionality with Shift key
- Add movement animations
