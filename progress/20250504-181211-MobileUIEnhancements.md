# Mobile UI Enhancements

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Optimized Virtual Joystick Placement
- Moved the virtual joystick further to the bottom-left corner (20px from edges)
- This provides better thumb access and improves visibility of the game world

### 2. Reorganized Skills Layout
- Implemented a fixed 2-row grid layout for skills
- Arranged skills in a specific order:
  * Top row: Skills 4, 5, 6, 7
  * Bottom row: Skills 1, 2, 3, h (primary)
- This organization matches the keyboard layout and improves muscle memory
- Used CSS grid with explicit placement for consistent ordering

### 3. Technical Implementation
- Used CSS grid layout instead of flexbox for more precise control
- Added explicit grid-area positioning for each skill button
- Ensured consistent display across different device sizes
- Maintained the semi-transparent, smaller buttons on mobile for better visibility

These enhancements further improve the mobile gaming experience by:
1. Providing better access to the virtual joystick in a more ergonomic position
2. Creating a consistent, logical layout for skills that matches keyboard controls
3. Maintaining good visibility of the game world while providing easy access to controls

The implementation ensures that the UI is optimized for landscape mode gaming on mobile devices, with controls positioned for comfortable thumb access.
