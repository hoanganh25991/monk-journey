# CSS Optimization

## Summary
Cleaned up the CSS file by removing duplicate styles where later styles override earlier ones. The file was originally a merge of components.css and ui.css, with ui.css styles taking precedence.

## Changes Made
- Removed duplicate `.home-button` class (overridden by `#home-button`)
- Updated section headers to make it clear that duplicates were removed
- Updated comments to remove references to the original components.css file
- Kept the optimized versions of styles where there were overrides

## File Structure
The CSS is now organized with a clean structure:
- Base UI components (player stats, health bars, etc.)
- Skill components
- Dialog and inventory components
- Virtual joystick
- UI component overrides (game menu, settings menu, etc.)
- Model preview components
- Loading screen
- Buttons and form elements
- Update notification

## Benefits
- Reduced file size
- Improved readability
- Eliminated redundant code
- Maintained all functionality with cleaner structure
