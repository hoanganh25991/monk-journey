# Skill Effect Cleanup Fix

## Issue
When holding keys to spam skills, the skill effects (models, particles, etc.) would remain on screen even after the skill duration had ended. This was particularly noticeable when the skill cooldown was less than the skill duration, allowing players to cast multiple instances of the same skill before the previous ones had expired.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive cleanup system for skill effects with the following improvements:

1. **Pre-emptive Cleanup in `useSkill`**
   - Added code to remove any existing instances of a skill before creating a new one
   - This ensures only one instance of each skill is active at any time
   - Prevents visual clutter when spamming skills

2. **Enhanced Cleanup in `updateSkills`**
   - Reduced the threshold for force cleanup from 95% to 85% of skill duration
   - Reduced the threshold for cleaning up older instances from 30% to 20% of skill duration
   - Reduced the maximum allowed skills per type from 2 to 1
   - These changes ensure more aggressive cleanup of skill effects

3. **Improved `remove` Method in Skill Class**
   - Enhanced the resource disposal logic to properly clean up all THREE.js objects
   - Added specific cleanup for each skill type's unique elements
   - Added disposal of additional texture types (normalMap, specularMap, emissiveMap)
   - Added cleanup of userData to prevent memory leaks
   - Added position and direction vector reset
   - Added more detailed logging for debugging

## Benefits
- Skill effects now properly disappear when new instances are cast
- No more lingering effects when spamming skills
- Reduced memory usage and improved performance
- Better visual clarity during combat

## Files Modified
- `/js/entities/palyer/Player.js`
- `/js/entities/Skill.js`

## Testing
The changes have been tested with various skills, particularly focusing on:
- Wave of Light (bell effect)
- Wave Strike
- Cyclone Strike
- Seven-Sided Strike
- Exploding Palm

All skills now properly clean up their effects when spamming, even when the cooldown is less than the duration.
