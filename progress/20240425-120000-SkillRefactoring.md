# Skill System Refactoring

## Summary
Refactored the Skill system to improve maintainability and organization by:
1. Separating the monolithic Skill.js file into multiple specialized classes
2. Creating a proper class hierarchy with base and specialized classes
3. Implementing a factory pattern for creating skill effects
4. Removing duplicate code and improving code organization

## Changes Made

### New File Structure
- Created a dedicated `skills` directory under `js/entities/`
- Implemented the following classes:
  - `Skill.js` - Base class for all skills
  - `SkillEffect.js` - Base class for all skill effects
  - `RangedSkillEffect.js` - Specialized effect for ranged skills
  - `AoESkillEffect.js` - Specialized effect for area of effect skills
  - `MultiSkillEffect.js` - Specialized effect for multi-hit skills
  - `SkillEffectFactory.js` - Factory for creating appropriate skill effects
  - `index.js` - Exports all skill-related classes

### Code Improvements
- Implemented proper inheritance hierarchy
- Extracted common functionality into base classes
- Separated effect creation and updating logic into specialized classes
- Added proper documentation with JSDoc comments
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Implemented the Factory pattern for creating skill effects

### Integration
- Updated import paths in PlayerSkills.js
- Updated service-worker.js to include new skill files
- Added missing methods required by the game:
  - `remove()` - Clean up skill effects
  - `updateCooldown()` - Update skill cooldown timer
  - `isExpired()` - Check if skill duration has expired
  - `startCooldown()` - Start the skill's cooldown timer

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed "Uncaught TypeError: skill.updateCooldown is not a function" by implementing the missing method
- Fixed "Uncaught TypeError: skill.getCooldownPercent is not a function" by adding an alias method
- Fixed "Uncaught TypeError: skill.getPosition is not a function" by adding position accessor methods
- Fixed missing teleport effect by implementing the TeleportSkillEffect class
- Ensured all methods used by PlayerSkills.js, HUDManager.js, and CollisionManager.js are properly implemented in the new Skill class

## Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused classes are easier to understand and modify
- **Extensibility**: Adding new skill types is now simpler with the factory pattern
- **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns between skill types
- **Reusability**: Common functionality is now in base classes
- **Readability**: Better code organization and documentation

## Next Steps
- Implement additional specialized skill effect classes for remaining skill types
- Add unit tests for the skill system
- Consider further optimizations for performance-critical sections
