# Local Development Setup

## Changes Made

1. Updated PWA Registration Script
   - Added detection for file:// protocol to prevent service worker registration errors
   - Added clear warning message when running from file:// protocol

2. Created Local Development Server
   - Added `local-server.js` - a simple Node.js HTTP server
   - Created `start-local-server.sh` script for easy server startup
   - Added comprehensive documentation in `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`

## Benefits

- Game can now be opened directly from file:// protocol without errors
- Clear warning messages help developers understand why PWA features aren't working
- Simple local server solution allows testing with full PWA functionality
- Documentation helps developers get started quickly

## How to Use

1. For basic testing without PWA features:
   - Open index.html directly in a browser
   - Service worker registration will be skipped with a warning

2. For full PWA functionality:
   - Run `./start-local-server.sh` or `node local-server.js`
   - Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser
