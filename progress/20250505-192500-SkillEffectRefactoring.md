# Skill Effect Refactoring

## Task Description
Refactored the skill effect code from the monolithic implementation in `js/entities/Skill.js.bak` to a modular structure in the `js/entities/skills` directory.

## Changes Made
1. Updated the `Skill.js` file to use the `SkillEffectFactory` for creating appropriate effect handlers
2. Verified that the specialized effect classes (RangedSkillEffect, AoESkillEffect, etc.) contain the correct implementations from the original file
3. Ensured that all skill effect types (ranged, AoE, multi, etc.) are properly implemented in their respective files

## Technical Details
- The original implementation had all skill effect logic in a single file
- The refactored structure separates concerns:
  - `Skill.js`: Base skill class that delegates effect creation to specialized handlers
  - `SkillEffect.js`: Base effect class with common functionality
  - `SkillEffectFactory.js`: Factory to create appropriate effect types
  - Specialized effect classes (RangedSkillEffect, AoESkillEffect, etc.) for each skill type

## Benefits
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to extend with new skill types
- Reduced file size and complexity for each component

## Verification
- Verified that special effects like Wave Strike and Cyclone Strike are properly implemented in their respective effect classes
- Ensured that the index.js file correctly exports all skill-related classes
