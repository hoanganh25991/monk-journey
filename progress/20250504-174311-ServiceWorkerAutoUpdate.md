# Service Worker Auto-Update Implementation

## Task Overview
Created an automated system to update the service worker cache when new files are added to the project, along with a user-friendly update notification.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created `update-service-worker.js` Script
- Automatically scans project directories for files to cache
- Updates the service-worker.js file with the new file list
- Increments the cache version number
- Configurable to include/exclude specific file types and directories

### 2. Enhanced Service Worker Update Experience
- Added a visual update notification to index.html
- Implemented a progress bar showing the update status
- Provides user feedback during the update process
- Automatically reloads the page when updates are ready

### 3. Key Features
- **Automatic File Discovery**: No need to manually update the asset list
- **Version Control**: Automatically increments the cache version
- **User Feedback**: Visual indicators for update progress
- **Seamless Updates**: Handles the update lifecycle with minimal user disruption

## Usage Instructions

1. **To update the service worker cache**:
   ```
   node update-service-worker.js
   ```

2. **When to run the script**:
   - After adding new files to the project
   - Before deploying updates to production
   - As part of your build process

3. **Configuration options** (in update-service-worker.js):
   - `directoriesToScan`: Directories to search for files
   - `fileExtensions`: File types to include in the cache
   - `alwaysInclude`: Files that should always be cached
   - `excludeFiles`: Files/directories to exclude from caching

## Benefits
- Eliminates manual service worker maintenance
- Ensures all project files are properly cached
- Provides a professional update experience for users
- Reduces the chance of caching-related bugs

## Future Enhancements
- Add command-line arguments for more flexible configuration
- Implement differential updates to minimize bandwidth usage
- Add support for precaching strategies based on file importance
