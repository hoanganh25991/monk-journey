# Loading Progress Size-Based Tracking

## Overview
This update completely revamps the loading progress tracking to better handle the large initial module download (11MB) that was causing the progress bar to stay at 0% and then suddenly jump to 100%.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Large Module Download Not Tracked
- Implemented size-based progress tracking instead of resource count-based tracking
- Added detection for the main module download (11MB) to properly show progress
- Implemented network activity monitoring to detect when downloads have completed

### 2. Progress Bar Accuracy
- Used actual file sizes from the Performance API to calculate progress
- Estimated total download size based on known module size (11MB)
- Implemented network speed detection to adjust progress calculation

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Added immediate visual feedback with initial progress at 5%
- Implemented network inactivity detection to identify when downloads are complete
- Added fallback mechanisms for browsers with limited Performance API support

## Implementation Details

1. **Size-Based Progress Tracking**:
   - Used the Performance API's `transferSize` or `encodedBodySize` to get actual file sizes
   - Calculated progress based on downloaded size relative to estimated total size
   - Added special handling for the main module which constitutes most of the download

2. **Network Activity Monitoring**:
   - Implemented tracking of download activity to detect when downloads have stopped
   - Added network speed calculation to adjust progress display for different connection speeds
   - Used inactivity detection to identify when the main module has finished loading

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Added time-based progress simulation for browsers without full Performance API support
   - Implemented acceleration of progress based on elapsed time
   - Added safety mechanisms to ensure progress always reaches 100%

4. **Debug Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive debug logging to help diagnose loading issues
   - Tracked network speed, download size, and progress calculations
   - Logged key events like module detection and download completion

## Benefits

- Progress bar now accurately reflects the download progress of the large module
- Users see continuous progress during the entire loading process
- Better user experience with immediate feedback and accurate progress indication
- Improved handling of different network speeds and conditions

## Technical Notes

- Used the Performance API's resource timing entries to track actual download sizes
- Implemented network speed detection based on download rate
- Added network inactivity detection to identify when downloads have completed
- Used time-based progress simulation as a fallback mechanism
