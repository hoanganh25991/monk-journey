# Infinite Grassy Terrain Implementation

## Overview
This update implements a system for generating infinite grassy terrain as the player explores the world. Previously, only the initial terrain had grass, and areas beyond it showed the water plane. Now, the entire world is covered with consistent grassy terrain that extends infinitely in all directions.

## Key Features
1. **Terrain Chunk System**: Dynamically generates terrain chunks as the player moves
2. **Seamless Visuals**: All terrain has the same grass texture and appearance
3. **Performance Optimized**: Only keeps terrain chunks near the player in memory
4. **Consistent Interaction**: Player can click and move on any terrain chunk

## Technical Implementation
1. **Terrain Chunk Management**:
   - Added a system to track and manage terrain chunks
   - Each chunk is 50x50 units in size
   - Chunks are generated in a 3-chunk radius around the player
   - Old chunks are removed when the player moves away

2. **Procedural Texturing**:
   - Implemented a procedural texture generator for grass
   - Each terrain chunk uses the same grass texture for consistency
   - Added subtle color variations to make the terrain look natural

3. **Input Handling**:
   - Updated the InputHandler to work with all terrain chunks
   - Player can now click on any terrain chunk to move there
   - Maintained the fallback system for areas between chunks

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Added proper disposal of terrain chunks when they're no longer needed
   - Only keeps necessary chunks in memory for better performance

## Gameplay Impact
- The world now appears as a continuous grassy plain in all directions
- No more blue water visible where terrain should be
- Player can explore infinitely with consistent visuals
- All objects (trees, rocks, buildings) appear properly positioned on the terrain

## Future Improvements
- Add terrain height variations for more interesting landscapes
- Implement different biomes with unique terrain textures
- Add terrain features like paths, rivers, and lakes
- Create a minimap system to help with navigation
