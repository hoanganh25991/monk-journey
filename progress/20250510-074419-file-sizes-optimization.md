# File Sizes Optimization

## Summary
Optimized the file-sizes.json generation and usage to:
1. Keep only essential fields: totalSizeBytes, totalSizeMB, totalFiles, and fileSizes
2. Update fileSizes to include all game files with their sizes and categories
3. Modify initial-load-progress.js to use the new structure

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified generate-file-sizes.js
- Removed unnecessary fields like fileCategories and categorySizes
- Updated fileSizes to include all game files with their sizes and categories
- Simplified the file structure for better performance

### 2. Updated initial-load-progress.js
- Modified fetchFileSizesFromServiceWorker() to work with the new file-sizes.json structure
- Updated getFileCategory() to use the category information from file-sizes.json
- Added fallback to extension-based categorization if file not found in data

## Benefits
- Reduced file-sizes.json complexity while maintaining all necessary information
- Improved loading progress tracking with accurate file categories
- Simplified code maintenance by providing explicit category information

## Testing
The script was successfully run and generated the updated file-sizes.json with the new structure. The initial-load-progress.js was updated to work with this new structure.

## Next Steps
- Monitor performance to ensure the loading progress indicator works correctly
- Consider further optimizations if needed
