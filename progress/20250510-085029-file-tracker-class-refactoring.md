# File Tracker Class Refactoring

## Overview
The file-tracker.js script has been refactored to use a class-based approach for better organization and maintainability. The functionality remains the same, but the code is now structured in a more object-oriented way.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a Class-Based Version**:
   - Converted the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to a proper ES6 class called `FileTracker`
   - All functions are now methods of the class
   - All variables are now properties of the class instance (using `this.`)

2. **Added TypeScript-like Documentation**:
   - Added JSDoc interfaces for better type clarity
   - Documented all methods and properties with JSDoc comments
   - Added return type annotations

3. **Improved Method Organization**:
   - Methods are grouped by functionality
   - Each method has a clear single responsibility

4. **Maintained Same API**:
   - The public API (`window.fileTracker.getStats()`) remains unchanged
   - The initialization is still automatic when the script is loaded

5. **Updated File References**:
   - Created a new file `file-tracker-class.js` with the refactored code
   - Updated `index.html` to reference the new file

## Benefits

1. **Better Code Organization**:
   - All related functionality is encapsulated in a class
   - Dependencies are clearly visible through `this` references

2. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Easier to understand the code structure
   - Easier to extend with new features
   - Better separation of concerns

3. **Better Documentation**:
   - Clear interfaces for data structures
   - Method documentation with parameter and return types

4. **Same Functionality**:
   - No changes to how the file tracker works
   - Same API for external code to interact with

## Files Modified
- Created: `/Users/anhle/work-station/diablo-immortal/pwa/file-tracker-class.js`
- Modified: `/Users/anhle/work-station/diablo-immortal/index.html`

## Next Steps
