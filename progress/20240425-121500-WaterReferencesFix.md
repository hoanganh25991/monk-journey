# Water References Fix - April 25, 2024

## Issue Fixed

### TypeError in CollisionManager.js

The game was throwing an error:
```
CollisionManager.js:219 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'position')
    at CollisionManager.checkPlayerTerrainCollisions (CollisionManager.js:219:46)
    at CollisionManager.update (CollisionManager.js:19:14)
    at Game.animate (Game.js:167:31)
    at Game.js:145:42
```

This error occurred because the water object was removed from the World class in the previous update, but the CollisionManager was still trying to access it in the checkPlayerTerrainCollisions method.

## Solution

Modified the `checkPlayerTerrainCollisions` method in CollisionManager.js to remove the reference to the water object:

1. Removed the code that was checking if the player is in water by comparing terrain height with water position
2. Replaced it with a simple statement that always sets the player's water state to false

## Changes Made

```javascript
// Old code (causing the error)
// Check if player is in water
if (terrainHeight < this.world.water.position.y) {
    // Player is in water, apply water effects
    this.player.setInWater(true);
} else {
    this.player.setInWater(false);
}

// New code (fixed)
// Water has been removed, so player is never in water
this.player.setInWater(false);
```

## Results

- The TypeError has been resolved
- The game no longer crashes when checking for terrain collisions
- The player is never considered to be in water, which is consistent with the removal of the water plane
