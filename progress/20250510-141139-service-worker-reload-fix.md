# Service Worker Reload Fix

## Issue
The game was experiencing multiple screen flashes during initial loading because the service worker registration process was causing page reloads that interrupted the file-tracker.js progress tracking.

## Analysis
1. When the page first loads, file-tracker.js starts tracking file downloads and shows progress.
2. At the same time, the service worker registration in registration.js is running.
3. There were two places in registration.js that called `window.location.reload()`:
   - When a service worker is installed and there's a controller (meaning an update)
   - When the service worker controller changes

These reloads were causing the loading screen to flash multiple times, interrupting the game loading process.

## Solution
Modified the service worker registration code to check if the game has finished loading before triggering a reload:

1. Added checks for `window.fileTracker` and `window.fileTrackerFinished` to determine if the game has finished loading
2. If the game is still loading (first time), skip the reload to prevent interruption
3. If the game has already loaded, proceed with the reload as normal

### Changes Made
1. Updated the controllerchange event handler to check game loading status before reloading
2. Updated the service worker state change handler for the 'installed' state to check game loading status before reloading

## Benefits
1. Eliminates the screen flashes during initial loading
2. Allows file-tracker.js to complete its progress tracking without interruption
3. Maintains the service worker functionality for offline and fast loading on subsequent visits
4. Improves the user experience by providing a smooth, uninterrupted loading process

## Testing
The changes should be tested by:
1. Loading the game for the first time in a fresh browser (or after clearing cache)
2. Verifying that the loading progress completes without interruption
3. Reloading the page to verify that the service worker is still functioning correctly
