# File Tracker Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a simplified file tracking system that focuses specifically on monitoring files listed in file-sizes.json. The system provides a real-time summary of downloaded and cached files compared to the total list, showing both file count and size-based progress.

## Key Features

### Immediate Observation
- Starts observing network requests as soon as possible
- Tracks files even before file-sizes.json is loaded
- Recalculates progress once file-sizes.json becomes available

### Progress Tracking
- Shows file count progress (e.g., 115/156 files loaded)
- Shows size-based progress (e.g., 8.5MB/9.93MB loaded)
- Distinguishes between downloaded and cached files

### User Interface
- Provides a non-intrusive overlay with current progress
- Updates in real-time as files are loaded
- Shows detailed breakdown of downloaded vs. cached files

### API for Integration
- Exposes a simple API for other scripts to access tracking data
- Can be integrated with existing loading screens

## Implementation Details

### File Tracking Logic
- Uses PerformanceObserver to monitor network requests
- Identifies files from file-sizes.json by filename
- Determines if files are downloaded or loaded from cache based on transferSize
- Calculates progress based on both file count and actual file sizes

### Progress Calculation
- Initially assumes total files from file-sizes.json (156 files)
- Shows percentage based on file count first
- Updates with actual file size information when available
- Provides both metrics for better user understanding

### Test Page
- Created a test page to demonstrate the file tracker in action
- Includes buttons to simulate loading files
- Shows real-time progress updates

## Usage

1. Include the file-tracker.js script in your HTML:
```html
<script src="file-tracker.js"></script>
```

2. Access tracking statistics programmatically:
```javascript
const stats = window.fileTracker.getStats();
console.log(`Files loaded: ${stats.downloadedFiles + stats.cachedFiles}/${stats.totalFiles}`);
console.log(`Progress: ${stats.fileCountPercent}% by count, ${stats.byteSizePercent}% by size`);
```

## Benefits

- **Simplified Implementation**: Focused solely on tracking files from file-sizes.json
- **Immediate Feedback**: Starts tracking as soon as possible
- **Accurate Reporting**: Distinguishes between downloaded and cached files
- **Dual Progress Metrics**: Shows both file count and size-based progress
- **Minimal Overhead**: Lightweight implementation with minimal impact on performance

This implementation provides users with clear visibility into the loading process, showing exactly how many files have been loaded (downloaded or from cache) compared to the total expected files.
