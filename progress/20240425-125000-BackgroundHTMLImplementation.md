# Background HTML Implementation Task Summary

## Task Description
Modified the implementation to define the background container directly in the index.html file instead of creating it dynamically in JavaScript.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated index.html
- Added a div with id "main-background" directly in the HTML
- Set all necessary styles inline (position, size, z-index, background properties)
- Used the correct relative path to the background image: 'assets/images/background.jpg'

### 2. Updated MainBackground.js
- Removed code that dynamically creates the background container
- Modified the init method to only apply the background image if needed
- Updated the applyBackgroundImage method to check if the image is already set
- Fixed the path to the background image to match the HTML

## Benefits
- Resolves the warning: "UIComponent.js:18 Container element with ID 'main-background' not found. Creating it dynamically."
- Improves page load performance by having the background defined in HTML
- Reduces JavaScript execution time
- Prevents potential flickering during background creation

## Implementation Details
- Background is positioned absolutely with z-index: -1
- Background image is set to cover the entire screen
- Background is placed at the beginning of the body element
- Background uses the existing assets/images/background.jpg file
