# Service Worker Generator Fix

## Issue
The service worker registration was failing with a syntax error in the generated service-worker.js file. The error was in a console.log statement that had mismatched quotes and incorrect string concatenation.

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the code, we found that the issue originated in the `generate-service-worker.js` script that automatically generates the service-worker.js file. The script was adding a console.log statement with a template literal that had a syntax error:

```javascript
console.log(`Total cache size: ${TOTAL_CACHE_SIZE_MB} MB` with progress tracking');
```

The string had mismatched quotes and an extra part "with progress tracking" that was outside the string template, causing the JavaScript parser to fail when evaluating the service worker script.

## Fix Implementation
1. Fixed the immediate issue in service-worker.js by correcting the syntax error
2. Updated the generator script in two places to prevent the issue from recurring:
   - Fixed the template for new service worker creation
   - Fixed the replacement pattern for updating existing service workers

The corrected code now properly includes the "with progress tracking" text inside the template literal:

```javascript
console.log(`Total cache size: ${TOTAL_CACHE_SIZE_MB} MB with progress tracking`);
```

## Verification
- Ran the generator script to create a new service worker (version 19)
- Verified that the syntax error was fixed in the generated file
- The service worker should now register correctly without evaluation errors

## Impact
- Fixed the service worker registration failure
- Ensured proper caching of application assets
- Restored offline functionality for the PWA
- Prevented the issue from recurring in future service worker updates

## Additional Notes
This fix demonstrates the importance of maintaining generator scripts that produce code. A small syntax error in the generator can propagate to the generated code and cause runtime errors that might be difficult to trace back to their source.
