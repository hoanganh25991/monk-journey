# Skill Effect Cleanup Fix

## Issue Fixed
Fixed the issue where skill effects (models, particles, effects) would persist after their duration when spamming skills by holding down keys.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Skill Cleanup in `Skill.js`
- Added immediate cleanup in the `update` method when a skill's duration is reached
- Improved the `remove` method to ensure all resources are properly disposed
- Added error handling to prevent crashes during cleanup
- Added null checks to prevent memory leaks

### 2. Improved Skill Management in `Player.js`
- Enhanced the `updateSkills` method with more robust cleanup logic
- Added safety checks for array bounds and null references
- Reduced the threshold for cleaning up skills when spamming from 110% to 95% of duration
- Reduced the threshold for cleaning up older instances of the same skill from 50% to 30% of duration
- Limited each named skill to only one active instance at a time
- Added a final cleanup pass to remove any invalid skills

### 3. Increased Skill Durations
- Wave Strike: 2.5s → 3.5s
- Cyclone Strike: 1.5s → 2.5s
- Seven-Sided Strike: 3.5s → 5.0s
- Inner Sanctuary: 7s → 10s
- Mystic Ally: 15s → 20s
- Wave of Light: 3.5s → 5.0s
- Exploding Palm: 15s → 20s

## Benefits
- Skills now properly clean up after their duration expires
- No more lingering effects when spamming skills
- Improved memory management and performance
- Longer skill durations provide better visual feedback and gameplay experience
- More robust error handling prevents crashes

## Technical Details
The main issue was that skills weren't being properly cleaned up when new instances of the same skill were rapidly created. The fix ensures that:

1. Each skill properly disposes of all its resources when removed
2. Only one instance of each named skill can be active at a time
3. Skills are forcefully cleaned up when they reach their duration
4. All THREE.js objects (geometries, materials, meshes) are properly disposed

This should result in a much cleaner visual experience and better performance when spamming skills.
