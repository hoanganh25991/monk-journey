# Disable Text Selection on UI Elements

## Overview
This update disables text selection on all UI elements in the game to improve the user experience, particularly on mobile devices. By preventing text selection, we ensure that buttons and other interactive elements are click-only, eliminating accidental text selection when interacting with the UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added User-Select: None to Global Styles
- Applied `user-select: none` to all elements using the universal selector
- Added vendor prefixes for cross-browser compatibility (`-webkit-user-select`, `-moz-user-select`, `-ms-user-select`)

### 2. Specifically Targeted UI Elements
- Added the property to the main UI container (`#ui-container`)
- Applied the property to skill buttons (`.skill-button`)
- Added the property to menu buttons (`.menu-button`)
- Applied the property to the virtual joystick elements (`#virtual-joystick-container`)

## Benefits
- Improved mobile gameplay experience by preventing accidental text selection
- Enhanced touch interaction with UI elements
- More professional look and feel when interacting with buttons and controls
- Consistent behavior across different browsers and devices

## Technical Implementation
The implementation uses CSS's `user-select` property with appropriate vendor prefixes to ensure compatibility across different browsers. This property prevents text selection when users click or tap on UI elements, making the interface behave more like a native application.

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding specific exceptions for elements where text selection might be useful (e.g., chat boxes, input fields)
- Monitor for any accessibility concerns related to disabling text selection
