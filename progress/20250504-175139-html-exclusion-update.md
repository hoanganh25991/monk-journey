# Service Worker HTML Exclusion Update

## Task Completed
Successfully updated the `update-service-worker.js` script to exclude all HTML files except for index.html.

## Changes Made
1. Removed '.html' from the `fileExtensions` array to stop automatically including HTML files
2. Removed specific HTML files from the `excludeFiles` array since we're now excluding all HTML files by default
3. Added explicit logic in the `scanDirectory` function to:
   - Skip HTML files except for index.html (which is already in the `alwaysInclude` array)
   - Continue including all other file types as before

## Testing Results
- Successfully updated the service-worker.js file and incremented the cache version to 3
- Verified that only index.html is included in the ASSETS_TO_CACHE array
- Confirmed that other HTML files (audio-generator.html, model-viewer.html, texture-generator.html) are now excluded

## Benefits
- Cleaner cache that only includes essential HTML files
- Reduced cache size by excluding unnecessary HTML files
- Maintains proper functionality by keeping index.html in the cache
- More maintainable approach that automatically excludes new HTML files without needing to update the exclude list

## Next Steps
The script is now fully functional with the updated HTML exclusion logic. No further changes are needed.
