# SaveManager Refactoring

## Summary
Refactored the SaveManager.js file to improve maintainability, reduce complexity, and separate concerns. The original monolithic class was split into multiple specialized components with clear responsibilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created a Modular Architecture
- Implemented interfaces for better type safety and documentation
- Separated storage concerns from serialization logic
- Created specialized serializers for different game components

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Simplified deeply nested try-catch blocks
- Added consistent error logging and notification
- Made error recovery more robust

### 3. Enhanced Code Organization
- Moved related functionality into separate files
- Created utility functions for common operations
- Implemented a clean interface for the save system

### 4. File Structure
```
js/core/save/
├── index.js                      # Main exports
├── ISaveSystem.js                # Interface for save systems
├── IStorageAdapter.js            # Interface for storage adapters
├── LocalStorageAdapter.js        # Implementation for localStorage
├── SaveManager.js                # Main implementation
├── serializers/
│   ├── PlayerSerializer.js       # Player data serialization
│   ├── QuestSerializer.js        # Quest data serialization
│   ├── SettingsSerializer.js     # Game settings serialization
│   └── WorldSerializer.js        # World data serialization
└── utils/
    └── SaveUtils.js              # Utility functions
```

### 5. Updated References
- Updated import in Game.js to use the new SaveManager location

## Benefits
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability
- Easier to extend with new features
- More robust error handling
- Clearer code organization
