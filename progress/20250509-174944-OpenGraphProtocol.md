# Open Graph Protocol Implementation

## Task Summary
Added Open Graph Protocol meta tags to the head section of index.html to improve social media sharing capabilities.

## Changes Made
- Added the following Open Graph meta tags:
  - `og:title`: Sets the title that appears when shared on social media
  - `og:description`: Provides a description for social media shares
  - `og:image`: Specifies the image to display when shared
  - `og:url`: Defines the canonical URL (currently empty, to be filled with actual URL)
  - `og:type`: Specifies the type of content (set to "website")
  - `og:site_name`: Sets the name of the site
  - `og:locale`: Defines the language and region (set to "en_US")

## Benefits
- Improved appearance when the page is shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn
- Better control over how content appears in social media feeds
- Enhanced social media engagement potential

## Notes
- The `og:url` tag is currently empty and should be updated with the actual URL when the site is deployed
- The `og:image` currently points to the same image as the favicon/apple-touch-icon
- Consider adding a larger, more detailed image specifically for social sharing (recommended size: 1200x630 pixels)
