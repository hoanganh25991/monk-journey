# Terrain Vibration Fix - April 25, 2024

## Issue Fixed

The terrain was still vibrating when the player first spawns, despite the previous fixes to match the terrain size and resolution. This vibration was caused by multiple systems trying to adjust the player's height simultaneously, creating a jittery effect.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Multiple Height Adjustments**: Both the Player's `updateTerrainHeight` method and the CollisionManager's `checkPlayerTerrainCollisions` method were adjusting the player's height, causing conflicts.

2. **Abrupt Height Changes**: The height adjustments were being applied instantly rather than smoothly transitioning.

3. **Inconsistent Model Updates**: The player model position wasn't always being updated consistently with the player's logical position.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Smooth Height Transitions

Modified the Player's `updateTerrainHeight` method to use a smooth interpolation approach:
```javascript
// Use a smooth transition to prevent vibration
const smoothFactor = 0.1; // Lower value = smoother transition
this.position.y += (targetHeight - this.position.y) * smoothFactor;
```

### 2. Separated Movement Logic

Updated the Player's `updateMovement` method to:
- Only update X and Z positions directly
- Let the `updateTerrainHeight` method handle Y position exclusively
- Update model position components individually

### 3. Removed Duplicate Height Adjustments

Modified the CollisionManager's `checkPlayerTerrainCollisions` method to:
- Validate player position and terrain height
- Defer actual height adjustment to the Player's `updateTerrainHeight` method
- This prevents multiple systems from fighting over the player's height

### 4. Improved Position Setting

Enhanced the Player's `setPosition` method to:
- Add a null check for the model group
- Ensure the model position is always in sync with the player position

## Results

- The terrain no longer vibrates when the player first spawns
- Player movement is smoother across all terrain
- The player's height adjusts gradually to terrain changes
- The camera follows the player more smoothly

These changes ensure a more consistent and visually pleasing experience when navigating the game world.
