# Auto Punch Implementation

## Overview
Added an automatic punch attack feature for the player character. When enemies are within melee range, the player will automatically punch them, dealing damage based on the player's stats and equipment.

## Changes Made

### Player.js
1. Added auto-punch properties to the Player class constructor:
   - `autoPunchCooldown`: Tracks the current cooldown time
   - `autoPunchCooldownTime`: Time between auto-punches (0.8 seconds)
   - `autoPunchRange`: Melee range for auto-punch detection (2.0 units)

2. Added new methods:
   - `updateAutoPunch(delta)`: Checks for nearby enemies and triggers auto-punch when cooldown is ready
   - `performAutoPunch(enemy)`: Executes the auto-punch attack on a specific enemy
   - `calculateAutoPunchDamage()`: Calculates damage based on player stats and equipment

3. Enhanced the punch animation:
   - Improved arm movement with a wind-up and follow-through animation
   - Added visual effects including a main impact sphere, expanding ring, and radiating impact lines
   - Added smooth animations for all visual elements

## Damage Calculation
The auto-punch damage is calculated based on:
- Base damage from player's attack power
- Bonus from strength (0.5 damage per point)
- Level bonus (2 damage per level)
- Weapon damage (if equipped)
- Random variation (Â±10%)

## Behavior
- Auto-punch activates when enemies are within 2.0 units of the player
- Has a 0.8 second cooldown between punches
- Won't activate if the player is already attacking or using a skill
- Player automatically turns to face the enemy being punched
- Damage numbers are displayed above the enemy

## Visual Effects
- Player's right arm animates with a realistic punch motion
- Blue energy sphere appears at the impact point
- White ring expands outward from the impact
- Small energy lines radiate from the impact in all directions
- All effects fade out smoothly

## Audio
- Uses the existing 'playerAttack' sound effect when punching

## Future Improvements
- Add different punch animations for variety
- Add critical hit chance and effects
- Add knockback effect on enemies
- Add combo system for consecutive punches
