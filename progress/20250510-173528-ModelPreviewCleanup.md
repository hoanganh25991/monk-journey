# Model Preview Cleanup

## Issue
The model preview is now working correctly, but we need to remove the debug elements that were added to help diagnose the rendering issues.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Debug Cube**:
   - Removed the `addDebugCube()` method
   - Removed the call to `addDebugCube()` in the `init()` method

2. **Removed Cube Rotation Code**:
   - Removed the code in the `animate()` method that was finding and rotating the debug cube

3. **Removed Debug Background Color**:
   - Removed the visible background color from the `#model-preview-fullscreen-wrapper` CSS rule

## Result
The model preview now displays the actual character models without any debug elements. The rendering is working correctly, and the interface is clean and professional.

## Retained Improvements
We've kept the following improvements that were made during debugging:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Try/catch blocks around critical rendering code
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting

2. **Improved CSS Structure**:
   - Proper positioning for container and wrapper
   - Forced dimensions to ensure correct sizing

3. **Better Initialization**:
   - Clearing of existing content in the wrapper
   - Checks for container existence

These improvements make the model preview more robust and easier to maintain in the future.
