# Performance Optimization and Memory Management

## Overview
This update focuses on enhancing the game's performance by improving memory management and optimizing the graphics quality settings. The changes aim to achieve a consistent 60 FPS across different devices while providing better control over quality settings.

## Changes Implemented

### Memory Management Enhancements
- Added memory usage monitoring and display (in MB)
- Implemented object disposal queue system to properly clean up unused resources
- Added automatic garbage collection hints to help browser manage memory
- Created texture and material disposal utilities to prevent memory leaks

### Graphics Quality Improvements
- Refined quality presets with better differentiation between levels:
  - Ultra: Maximum visual quality (full shadows, high resolution textures)
  - High: Good balance of quality and performance
  - Medium: Balanced for mid-range devices
  - Low: Optimized for performance
  - Minimal: Maximum performance, lowest quality
- Adjusted quality thresholds for more responsive adaptation:
  - More conservative quality increases (requires 20% headroom)
  - More aggressive quality decreases when performance drops below 90% of target
  - Special handling for medium quality to prevent unnecessary quality reduction

### UI Enhancements
- Added Graphics Settings section to Settings menu
- Implemented quality preset selection with descriptive labels
- Added toggle for adaptive quality
- Added toggle for performance statistics display

### Performance Optimizations
- Improved texture quality management based on quality level
- Added object detail level management to limit visible objects
- Enhanced shadow map size adjustment for better performance
- Implemented progressive object loading and disposal

## Technical Details

### Memory Management
The new memory management system tracks JavaScript heap usage and displays it in MB. It also implements a queue-based disposal system that properly cleans up Three.js objects, including:
- Geometries
- Materials
- Textures
- Scene objects

### Quality Settings
Each quality preset now controls multiple aspects of rendering:
- Shadow quality and map size
- Texture quality and filtering
- Object detail level
- Maximum visible objects
- Draw distance
- Antialiasing
- Pixel ratio

### Performance Monitoring
The performance monitoring system now tracks:
- FPS (frames per second)
- Memory usage in MB
- GPU information
- Quality level changes

## Results
These changes should result in:
1. More consistent frame rates across different devices
2. Reduced memory usage and fewer memory leaks
3. Better visual quality at medium settings
4. More responsive quality adaptation
5. Improved user control over performance vs. quality tradeoffs

## Future Improvements
- Implement LOD (Level of Detail) system for complex objects
- Add texture compression options
- Implement occlusion culling for better performance
- Add more granular control over individual graphics settings
