# Service Worker Cache Update

## Task Completed
Updated the service worker cache list to include all current files in the project.

## Changes Made
1. Updated the cache version from `monk-journey-v1` to `monk-journey-v2`
2. Added all JavaScript files from the project structure:
   - Added missing core files (DifficultyManager.js, PerformanceManager.js, QuestManager.js)
   - Added all world-related files (environment, interactive, lighting, structures, terrain, utils, zones)
3. Added SVG logo files that were missing from the cache
4. Added all audio files from the assets/audio directory
5. Organized the cache list with comments for better readability

## Benefits
- Improved offline functionality by ensuring all necessary files are cached
- Better organization of the cache list for future maintenance
- Updated cache version to ensure clients receive the latest files

The service worker now properly caches all JavaScript, CSS, audio, and image files required for the application to function offline.
