# Exploding Palm Skill Fix

## Issue Summary
The "Exploding Palm" skill was not visible on screen despite the code being mostly complete. The palm effect was not appearing when the skill was used.

## Root Causes
1. **Size Issues**: The palm and its components were too small to be easily visible in the game world
2. **Visibility Issues**: The emissive intensity and opacity values were too low
3. **Positioning Issues**: The palm wasn't properly positioned in the player's view
4. **Orientation Issues**: The palm wasn't properly oriented to face the direction the player was looking

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Size and Visibility
- Increased the size of the palm base from 0.8×0.2×1 to 1.2×0.3×1.5
- Increased the size of fingers by 50%
- Increased the size of fingernails by 50%
- Increased the size of the energy aura from radius 1 to 1.5
- Added more particles (45 instead of 30) and made them larger
- Added more trailing effects (7 instead of 5) and made them larger

### 2. Improved Visual Effects
- Increased emissive intensity for all components (from 1 to 2-3)
- Increased opacity values for better visibility
- Improved particle animation speeds
- Enhanced the energy aura with larger scale (1.5, 0.75, 1.8)

### 3. Fixed Positioning and Orientation
- Raised the hand position from y=1 to y=1.5 for better visibility
- Added explicit rotation to ensure the palm faces the direction the player is looking
- Added debug logging to confirm the effect is being created with correct position and orientation

### 4. Improved Explosion Effect
- Increased the size of the giant palm for the explosion effect
- Improved the shape of the explosion palm with larger center and fingers
- Increased the rotation speed and scale of the explosion effect

## Expected Results
The "Exploding Palm" skill should now be clearly visible when used:
1. A large red palm with glowing fingers should appear in front of the player
2. The palm should move in the direction the player is facing
3. The palm should be surrounded by glowing particles and trailing effects
4. When the palm reaches its target or maximum distance, it should explode into a giant palm shape

## Debugging
Added console logging to help track the creation and positioning of the effect, which will help identify any remaining issues.
