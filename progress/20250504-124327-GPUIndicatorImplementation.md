# GPU Indicator Implementation

## Overview
Added a GPU indicator next to the FPS counter that shows detailed GPU information when hovered over. This helps users understand their hardware capabilities and confirm that GPU acceleration is active.

## Implementation Details

### 1. GPU Indicator
- Added a green "GPU" indicator next to the Stats.js FPS counter
- Positioned to be easily visible but not intrusive
- Styled to match the game's aesthetic

### 2. GPU Information Panel
- Shows detailed GPU information on hover
- Includes:
  - GPU vendor and renderer name
  - WebGL and GLSL versions
  - Maximum texture size and viewport dimensions
  - Hardware acceleration status
  - Power preference setting
  - Render buffer size

### 3. GPU Acceleration Detection
- Implemented multiple methods to detect if GPU acceleration is active:
  - Checks for software rendering indicators in the renderer string
  - Verifies WebGL support and capabilities
  - Confirms high-performance power preference is active
  - Provides clear visual indication of acceleration status

### 4. Visual Design
- Green text indicates GPU acceleration is active
- Clean, monospaced font for technical information
- Semi-transparent background for better readability
- Hover effects for better user interaction

## Benefits
- Users can easily verify that GPU acceleration is working
- Provides transparency about the rendering capabilities
- Helps with troubleshooting performance issues
- Gives technical users insight into the rendering pipeline

## Technical Notes
- Uses the WebGL debug renderer info extension to get accurate GPU information
- Falls back gracefully if certain information isn't available
- Styled using CSS classes for consistency and maintainability
- Designed to work across different browsers and devices
