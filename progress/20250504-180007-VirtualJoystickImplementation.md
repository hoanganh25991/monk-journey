# Virtual Joystick Implementation

## Overview
This update implements a virtual joystick for movement control and removes the click-to-move functionality. The joystick appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen on all devices, allowing players to control movement with their thumb while using their other hand for skills.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Virtual Joystick UI
- Created a joystick container with base and handle elements
- Added CSS styling for the joystick components with enhanced visibility
- Implemented touch and mouse event handlers for joystick interaction
- Made the joystick always visible on all devices

### 2. Modified Input Handling
- Updated the `getMovementDirection()` method to incorporate joystick input
- Removed click-to-move functionality from mouse events
- Maintained keyboard controls (WASD/Arrow keys) for desktop users

### 3. Integrated with Existing Systems
- Added joystick state tracking in the UIManager
- Ensured joystick input overrides keyboard input when active
- Preserved interaction with objects and attack functionality

## Technical Implementation
The virtual joystick uses touch events to track finger position relative to the joystick center. The direction and magnitude of movement are normalized and passed to the player's movement system. The joystick automatically resets when released.

## Benefits
- Improved mobile gameplay experience
- More intuitive controls for touch devices
- Consistent movement control across platforms
- Better alignment with modern mobile game standards

## Future Improvements
- Add haptic feedback for touch devices
- Implement customizable joystick position
- Add joystick sensitivity settings
- Consider adding a second joystick for camera control
