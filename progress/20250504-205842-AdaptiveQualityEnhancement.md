# Adaptive Quality Enhancement Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the performance management system to provide more intelligent and conservative quality adjustments based on FPS performance. The system now targets 30 FPS (instead of 60) and implements a more gradual approach to quality changes, requiring multiple consecutive FPS checks before adjusting quality settings.

## Changes Made

1. **Target FPS Adjustment**
   - Changed target FPS from 60 to 30 to better match game requirements

2. **Conservative Quality Adjustment**
   - Added counters to track consecutive high/low FPS readings
   - Implemented thresholds for quality changes:
     - Requires 5 consecutive low FPS readings before decreasing quality
     - Requires 10 consecutive high FPS readings before increasing quality
   - Added cooldown periods after quality changes to allow the system to stabilize

3. **Quality Level Transitions**
   - Enabled transitions between all quality levels (minimal → low → medium → high → ultra)
   - Implemented more conservative thresholds for aggressive quality decreases
   - Added detailed logging of quality changes

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Added a quality indicator display showing current quality level
   - Implemented color-coding for different quality levels
   - Added ability to toggle adaptive quality through the UI

## Technical Implementation Details

- Added tracking variables for consecutive FPS readings
- Modified quality adjustment logic to be more conservative
- Implemented UI components to display quality status
- Added detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- Ensured smooth transitions between all quality levels

## Benefits

1. **Better Performance Stability**
   - More conservative approach prevents frequent quality fluctuations
   - System adapts more gradually to performance changes

2. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Visual feedback on current quality level
   - Ability to toggle adaptive quality
   - More detailed notifications about quality changes

3. **Optimized Resource Usage**
   - Better targeting of appropriate quality level for device capabilities
   - More efficient use of GPU and CPU resources

## Testing Notes

The system should be tested on various devices to ensure:
- Proper adaptation to different hardware capabilities
- Smooth transitions between quality levels
- Appropriate FPS maintenance at target 30 FPS
- UI indicators function correctly
