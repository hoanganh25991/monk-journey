# Level Up Notification Fix

## Issue
The level up notification was not being displayed when a player leveled up. This was due to an issue in the `addExperience` method in the `PlayerStats.js` file, which wasn't properly returning the player's level after a level up occurred.

## Solution
Modified the `addExperience` method in `PlayerStats.js` to:
1. Track whether a level up occurred during experience addition
2. Return the current level if a level up occurred, otherwise return 0
3. This ensures the condition in `Player.js` correctly identifies when to show the level up notification

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/anhle/work-station/diablo-immortal/js/entities/player/PlayerStats.js`
   - Added a flag to track level changes
   - Added explicit return value for when no level up occurs
   - Ensured the method always returns a value (either the new level or 0)

## How It Works
1. When a player gains experience, the `addExperience` method is called
2. If the experience causes a level up, the method now returns the new level
3. If no level up occurs, the method returns 0
4. The `Player.js` file checks if the returned value is greater than 0 to determine if a level up notification should be shown

This fix ensures that the level up notification is properly displayed whenever the player levels up, enhancing the player experience with appropriate feedback.
