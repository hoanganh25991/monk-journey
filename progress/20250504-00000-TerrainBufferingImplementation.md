# Terrain Buffering Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a terrain buffering system to pre-render terrain chunks ahead of the player's movement. This significantly reduces lag when moving to new areas by ensuring terrain is already generated before the player reaches it.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Terrain Buffer System
- Added a terrain buffer to store pre-generated terrain chunks that aren't yet visible
- Implemented a larger buffer distance (6 chunks) compared to the visible distance (3 chunks)
- Created a priority queue for terrain generation based on player movement direction

### 2. Predictive Loading
- Added player movement direction tracking to predict which chunks to load first
- Prioritized chunk generation in the direction the player is moving
- Implemented a dot product calculation to determine which chunks are most likely to be needed soon

### 3. Asynchronous Terrain Generation
- Created an asynchronous queue processing system for terrain generation
- Used setTimeout to avoid blocking the main thread during terrain generation
- Implemented a small delay (10ms) between chunk generations to maintain game responsiveness

### 4. Chunk Recycling
- Instead of destroying chunks that go out of view, they're moved to the buffer if within buffer distance
- This allows for quick restoration when the player returns to previously visited areas
- Only chunks outside the buffer distance are fully removed from memory

### 5. Debug Information
- Added debug logging to track the number of active chunks, buffered chunks, and queue size
- Added a debugMode flag to the Game class to enable/disable debug logging

## Benefits
- Smoother gameplay experience with reduced lag when exploring new areas
- More efficient resource usage by recycling terrain chunks
- Better performance by distributing terrain generation over time
- Improved player experience by hiding the "pop-in" effect of new terrain

## Technical Notes
- The buffer distance is configurable via `terrainBufferDistance` (currently set to 6)
- The visible distance remains at 3 chunks for performance reasons
- Terrain generation is prioritized based on player movement direction
- Chunks in the buffer are fully generated but not added to the scene until needed
