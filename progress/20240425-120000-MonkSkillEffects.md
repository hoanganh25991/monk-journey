# Monk Skill Effects Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of visually impressive skill effects for the monk class in the Diablo Immortal project. Four key monk skills have been enhanced with complex visual effects and animations:

1. **Seven-Sided Strike** - A multi-hit attack with teleporting monk figures
2. **Inner Sanctuary** - A protective zone with magical runes and energy
3. **Mystic Ally** - A summoned spirit companion with ethereal effects
4. **Exploding Palm** - A mark that builds up and explodes with blood effects

## Implementation Details

### Seven-Sided Strike
- Created a dynamic monk figure that teleports to multiple positions
- Implemented sequential activation of strikes with numbered indicators
- Added motion blur and energy effects for each strike
- Connected strikes with energy lines
- Added central vortex and flash effects
- Implemented smooth transitions between strike positions

### Inner Sanctuary
- Created a protective dome with reactive opacity
- Added glowing edge ring with rotation animation
- Implemented protective runes that hover and pulse
- Added energy pillars at cardinal points
- Created central mandala pattern with lotus symbol
- Added floating particles with orbit animations
- Implemented smooth fade-in and fade-out transitions

### Mystic Ally
- Created a summoning circle with magical runes and symbols
- Implemented energy rings with rotation animations
- Added converging particles during summoning phase
- Created ethereal ally with glowing eyes and energy wisps
- Added swirling energy patterns around the ally
- Implemented three distinct phases: summoning, active, and dissipating
- Added particle effects during transitions

### Exploding Palm
- Created a blood-like mark with palm symbol
- Added blood splatter effects around the mark
- Implemented floating blood particles with orbit animations
- Created pulsing energy ring with rotation
- Added build-up effects as explosion approaches
- Implemented dramatic explosion with a giant palm rising from the ground
- Added expanding waves and particle burst during explosion
- Created dynamic animation for the giant palm (scaling, rising, rotating, and fading)

## Technical Approach
- Used THREE.js geometry and materials for all visual elements
- Implemented custom animation states for each skill
- Used userData to store animation parameters for individual elements
- Created phase-based animations with smooth transitions
- Implemented particle systems with physics-based behaviors
- Used emissive materials for glowing effects
- Added randomization for natural-looking effects

## Future Improvements
- Add sound effects synchronized with visual effects
- Implement damage feedback when skills hit enemies
- Add environmental interactions (water ripples, dust, etc.)
- Optimize particle systems for better performance
- Add more variation to skill effects based on skill runes/modifiers

## Conclusion
The implemented skill effects provide a visually impressive and dynamic experience that captures the essence of the monk class in Diablo Immortal. The effects are designed to be both visually appealing and informative about the skill's function and impact.
