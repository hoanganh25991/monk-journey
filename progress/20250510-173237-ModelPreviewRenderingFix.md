# Model Preview Rendering Fix

## Issue
The canvas for the model preview was being created successfully, but nothing was being rendered. This could be due to several potential issues:

1. Visibility detection problems
2. Incorrect dimensions for the wrapper or container
3. THREE.js initialization issues
4. Model loading problems

## Solution
Implemented several debugging and fix measures:

1. **Enhanced Visibility Detection**:
   - Added debugging logs to the visibility observer
   - Set `isVisible` to true initially to ensure rendering starts

2. **Added Debug Cube**:
   - Added a simple red cube to the scene to verify rendering is working
   - Added rotation animation to the cube to make it more visible

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added try/catch blocks around critical rendering code
   - Added more detailed logging throughout the initialization process

4. **Fixed CSS Styling**:
   - Added `position: relative` to the container
   - Added `position: absolute` to the wrapper
   - Used `!important` to ensure dimensions are applied
   - Added a visible background color for debugging

5. **Enhanced Initialization**:
   - Added code to clear any existing content in the wrapper
   - Added more detailed logging during initialization
   - Added checks for container existence

## Expected Results
With these changes, we should now see:

1. A red cube rendering in the model preview area (even if the model itself doesn't load)
2. More detailed console logs to help identify any remaining issues
3. Proper sizing and positioning of the canvas

## Next Steps
If the debug cube is visible but models still don't load, we should:

1. Check the model file paths
2. Verify the GLTFLoader is working correctly
3. Add more debugging to the model loading process

If the debug cube is not visible, we should:

1. Check for WebGL support in the browser
2. Verify THREE.js is being loaded correctly
3. Check for any console errors related to THREE.js initialization
