# Skill Effect Integration

## Task Description
Integrated the refactored Skill.js file with the specialized effect implementations from the original Skill.js.bak file.

## Changes Made
1. Created a new Skill.js file that uses the SkillEffectFactory to delegate effect creation to specialized handlers
2. Verified that all specialized effect classes (RangedSkillEffect, AoESkillEffect, etc.) contain the correct implementations from the original file
3. Ensured that special effects like Wave Strike and Cyclone Strike are properly implemented in their respective effect files

## Technical Details
- The original monolithic implementation had all skill effect logic in a single file
- The refactored structure separates concerns:
  - `Skill.js`: Base skill class that delegates effect creation to specialized handlers
  - `SkillEffect.js`: Base effect class with common functionality
  - `SkillEffectFactory.js`: Factory to create appropriate effect types
  - Specialized effect classes for each skill type:
    - `RangedSkillEffect.js`: Contains the Wave Strike implementation
    - `AoESkillEffect.js`: Contains the Cyclone Strike implementation
    - Other specialized effect classes for different skill types

## Benefits
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to extend with new skill types
- Reduced file size and complexity for each component

## Verification
- Verified that special effects like Wave Strike and Cyclone Strike are properly implemented in their respective effect classes
- Ensured that the index.js file correctly exports all skill-related classes
