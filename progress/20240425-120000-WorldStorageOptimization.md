# World Storage Optimization

## Summary
Implemented an optimized local storage solution for the game world to reduce memory usage and improve performance. The new system stores world chunks individually in local storage and only loads them when needed, significantly reducing the memory footprint and improving game performance.

## Key Changes

1. **Level-Based Saving**
   - Added a level-based saving system that only saves the world at specific player level milestones (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50)
   - Reduced auto-save frequency from every minute to every 5 minutes
   - Added a minimum time between saves (10 minutes) to prevent excessive saving

2. **Chunk-Based Storage**
   - Implemented individual chunk storage in local storage
   - Each chunk is saved with a unique key based on its coordinates
   - Created a chunk index to track all saved chunks

3. **Lazy Loading**
   - Added placeholder objects for buffered chunks to reduce memory usage
   - Chunks are only fully loaded when they come into view
   - Environment objects are only created when needed

4. **Optimized Data Structures**
   - Reduced the amount of data stored for each chunk
   - Separated structure data from actual 3D objects
   - Added a data-only mode for structure generation

5. **Improved Loading**
   - Only loads chunks near the player's current position
   - Prioritizes loading chunks in the player's movement direction
   - Properly cleans up unused chunks to free memory

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Memory Usage**
   - Significantly reduced memory footprint by only keeping necessary chunks in memory
   - Placeholder objects use minimal memory until needed

2. **Improved Performance**
   - Less data to process during save/load operations
   - Reduced lag when moving through the world
   - More efficient terrain generation

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Game saves at meaningful milestones rather than constantly
   - Smoother gameplay with less interruption
   - Faster loading times

## Technical Implementation

1. Modified `SaveManager.js` to implement:
   - Level-based saving logic
   - Individual chunk storage
   - Optimized loading process

2. Updated `World.js` to support:
   - Placeholder terrain chunks
   - Lazy loading of environment objects
   - Data-only structure generation

## Future Improvements

1. Add a chunk cleanup system to remove old, unused chunks from local storage
2. Implement a priority queue for chunk loading based on player movement
3. Add compression for stored chunk data to further reduce storage requirements
