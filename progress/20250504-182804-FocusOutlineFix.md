# Focus Outline Fix for UI Elements

## Overview
This update fixes the issue where a light blue square (default browser focus outline) appears when clicking on skill buttons and other UI elements. The update replaces the default focus outline with custom circular focus effects that match the game's aesthetic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Default Focus Outlines
- Added a global rule to remove the default focus outline for all interactive elements
- Applied `outline: none` to all buttons, links, and interactive divs
- Specifically targeted skill buttons, menu buttons, and the virtual joystick

### 2. Added Custom Focus Styles
- Created a custom circular focus effect for skill buttons using box-shadow
- Added an orange border highlight for skill buttons when focused
- Implemented a subtle glow effect for menu buttons when focused
- Ensured the virtual joystick elements don't show any focus effects

### 3. Improved Mobile Experience
- The changes ensure that mobile users don't see the rectangular focus outline
- Touch interactions now feel more natural and app-like
- Circular focus effects match the circular button design

## Technical Implementation
The implementation uses CSS's `outline: none` property to remove the default browser focus outline and replaces it with custom `box-shadow` and `border-color` properties that respect the circular shape of the buttons. This creates a more polished and consistent user interface.

## Benefits
- More visually appealing UI with consistent circular focus effects
- Improved mobile gameplay experience
- Better alignment with the game's visual design
- More professional look and feel when interacting with UI elements

## Accessibility Considerations
While we've removed the default focus outlines, we've replaced them with custom focus indicators that maintain visual feedback for keyboard users. This ensures the game remains accessible while improving its visual design.
