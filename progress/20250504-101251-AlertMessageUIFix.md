# Alert Message UI Fix

## Issue
The alert messages in the middle of the screen were taking up too much space, sometimes consuming the entire height of the screen when many messages appeared simultaneously. This made it difficult to see other elements on the screen, especially when spawning skills that generated multiple messages.

## Solution
I implemented several improvements to the notification system:

1. **Limited Notification Area**
   - Strictly enforced the 1/5 screen height limit for notifications
   - Added better compression and scaling for notifications when many are displayed
   - Improved spacing and layout to make notifications more compact

2. **Intelligent Message Management**
   - Added message rate detection to identify when messages are coming in quickly
   - Implemented faster removal of old messages when new ones are appearing rapidly
   - Reduced notification lifetime dynamically based on message frequency

3. **Duplicate Message Handling**
   - Enhanced duplicate detection to identify and consolidate repeated messages
   - Added counter display for frequently repeated messages (e.g., "Message (3x)")
   - Automatically removed or shortened the lifetime of duplicate notifications

4. **Visual Improvements**
   - Made notifications more compact with smaller padding and font size
   - Added text truncation with ellipsis for long messages
   - Improved fade-out and slide-up animations for smoother transitions

## Technical Implementation
- Added a `getMessageRate()` method to calculate the frequency of incoming messages
- Enhanced the `compressNotifications()` method to scale and position notifications more efficiently
- Improved the `deduplicateNotifications()` method to better handle repeated messages
- Updated the `updateNotifications()` method to dynamically adjust expiry rates and animations

These changes ensure that alert messages are now properly contained within 1/5 of the screen height, allowing players to see more of the game area while still receiving important notifications.
