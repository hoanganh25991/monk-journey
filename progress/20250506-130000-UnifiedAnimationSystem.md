# Unified Animation System

## Summary
Implemented a unified animation system that synchronizes animation playback between the model preview in the settings menu and the player model in the game. This allows users to preview and select animations in the settings menu, which will then be applied to the player model in the game.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed reference error in main.js where animation dropdown elements were being accessed before initialization
- Improved error handling for cases where no animations are available

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Shared Animation Utility
- Added new `AnimationUtils.js` file with shared animation functions:
  - `playAnimation()`: Handles animation selection and crossfade
  - `findAnimationsByType()`: Finds animations by keyword
  - `getBestMatchingAnimation()`: Gets the best animation match from a list of keywords

### 2. Enhanced ModelPreview.js
- Added animation management similar to PlayerModel
- Modified to use the shared AnimationUtils for animation playback
- Added methods to get animation names and current animation
- Modified `loadModel()` to store animations by name

### 3. Updated main.js Options Menu
- Added animation dropdown to character model settings
- Implemented animation selection that affects both preview and player model
- Added dynamic population of animation options when model changes
- Synchronized animation state between preview and game

### 4. Enhanced PlayerModel.js
- Modified to use the shared AnimationUtils for animation playback
- Updated animation selection logic to use utility functions
- Added methods to expose animation information:
  - `getAnimationNames()`: Returns list of available animations
  - `getCurrentAnimation()`: Returns the currently playing animation

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows these key principles:
1. **Shared Animation Logic**: Animation code is now centralized in AnimationUtils.js to avoid duplication
2. **Consistent Animation Interface**: Both ModelPreview and PlayerModel now use the same pattern for animation management
3. **Seamless Animation Transfer**: Animations selected in the preview are automatically applied to the player model
4. **Dynamic Animation Discovery**: The system automatically detects and lists available animations for each model
5. **Graceful Fallbacks**: If an animation isn't found, the system tries to find similar animations by name
6. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes to animation logic only need to be made in one place

## Usage
1. Open the settings menu
2. Select a character model
3. Use the Animation dropdown to select and preview different animations
4. The selected animation will be applied to the player model when returning to the game

## Technical Notes
- Animation crossfading is used for smooth transitions between animations
- The system handles models with different animation naming conventions
- Animation state is preserved when switching between models
