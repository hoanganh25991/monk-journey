# Loading Screen Progress Update

## Summary
Updated the loading screen progress messages to better reflect the actual loading process of the game. The changes make the loading screen more accurate by:

1. Showing more realistic progress messages during the file download phase (0-99%)
2. Adding a 3-second initialization phase after downloads complete
3. Breaking down the initialization into two parts:
   - Game engine initialization (1.5s)
   - Game.start() execution (1.5s)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Progress Messages
Modified the progress messages to be more specific about what's happening during each phase of loading:
- 0-20%: "Downloading core game files..."
- 20-40%: "Downloading game assets..."
- 40-60%: "Downloading game resources..."
- 60-80%: "Downloading additional content..."
- 80-99%: "Download almost complete..."
- 99-100%: "Initializing main.js..."
- 100%: "Starting game engine..." followed by "Executing game.start()..."

### 2. Added File Information
Added more specific information about what files are being processed during each phase:
- Added a "currentFile" variable to display alongside the main progress message
- This gives users more detailed information about what's happening

### 3. Improved Completion Sequence
Modified the completion sequence to show a more accurate representation of the game initialization process:
- After assets are loaded (100%), show a message about starting the game engine (3s remaining)
- After 1.5 seconds, update to show game.start() execution (1.5s remaining)
- After another 1.5 seconds, hide the loading screen

## Testing Notes
The changes maintain the same overall loading experience but provide more accurate and detailed information to users about what's happening during the loading process. The total loading time remains the same, but the messaging is now more aligned with the actual technical process.
