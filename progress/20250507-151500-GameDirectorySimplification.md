# Game Directory Simplification

## Changes Made

1. Simplified the directory structure by consolidating all game-related files into a single `js/core/game` directory:
   - Moved GameState.js to js/core/game/GameState.js
   - Moved GameEvents.js to js/core/game/GameEvents.js
   - Moved SceneOptimizer.js to js/core/game/SceneOptimizer.js
   - Renamed LoadingManagerService.js to js/core/game/LoadingManager.js
   - Created a new Game.js in js/core/game/Game.js based on the original Game.js.bak
   - Added GameFacade.js to js/core/game/GameFacade.js for compatibility

2. Created an index.js file in the js/core/game directory to export all components

3. Updated main.js to import the Game class from the new location

4. Updated the original GameFacade.js to extend the new Game class for backward compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Directory Structure**:
   - All game-related files are now in a single directory
   - Easier to navigate and understand the codebase

2. **Improved Code Organization**:
   - Related files are grouped together
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Maintained Original Functionality**:
   - The new Game.js maintains the same functionality as the original Game.js.bak
   - No changes to the game's behavior or API

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Existing code that uses GameFacade will continue to work
   - Deprecation warnings added to guide future development

## Next Steps

1. Remove the original files that have been replaced:
   - js/core/GameCore.js
   - js/core/GameState.js
   - js/core/GameEvents.js
   - js/core/SceneOptimizer.js
   - js/core/LoadingManagerService.js
   - js/core/interfaces/GameInterface.js
   - js/core/managers/GameAccessors.js
   - js/core/managers/GameEventManager.js

2. Update any other files that might be importing from the old locations

3. Test the game to ensure everything works as expected
