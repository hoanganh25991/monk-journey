# Player Methods Fix

## Issue
After refactoring the Player class, an error occurred during game initialization:
```
Error initializing game: TypeError: this.game.player.getLevel is not a function
    at HUDManager.createPlayerUI (HUDManager.js:79:70)
    at HUDManager.init (HUDManager.js:19:14)
    at Game.init (Game.js:114:30)
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by missing methods in the refactored Player class:

1. In the original monolithic Player class, methods like `getLevel()` were directly implemented
2. In the refactored Player class, these methods were moved to component classes (e.g., PlayerStats)
3. The Player class needed to delegate these method calls to the appropriate components
4. External classes like HUDManager were still calling these methods on the Player instance

## Solution
The solution involved adding delegation methods to the Player class:

1. Added stats getter methods to delegate to PlayerStats:
   ```javascript
   getLevel() {
       return this.stats.getLevel();
   }
   
   getHealth() {
       return this.stats.getHealth();
   }
   
   getMaxHealth() {
       return this.stats.getMaxHealth();
   }
   
   // ... and more
   ```

2. Added skills getter methods to delegate to PlayerSkills:
   ```javascript
   getSkills() {
       return this.skills.getSkills();
   }
   
   getActiveSkills() {
       return this.skills.getActiveSkills();
   }
   ```

3. Added inventory getter methods to delegate to PlayerInventory:
   ```javascript
   getInventory() {
       return this.inventory.getInventory();
   }
   
   getEquipment() {
       return this.inventory.getEquipment();
   }
   
   getGold() {
       return this.inventory.getGold();
   }
   ```

4. Added a method to access the stats object for backward compatibility:
   ```javascript
   getStatsObject() {
       return this.stats;
   }
   ```

5. Updated HUDManager to use proper methods instead of direct access to the stats object:
   ```javascript
   // Before
   this.game.player.stats.health += 50;
   if (this.game.player.stats.health > this.game.player.stats.maxHealth) {
       this.game.player.stats.health = this.game.player.stats.maxHealth;
   }
   
   // After
   const newHealth = this.game.player.getHealth() + 50;
   const maxHealth = this.game.player.getMaxHealth();
   this.game.player.getStatsObject().setHealth(Math.min(newHealth, maxHealth));
   ```

## Benefits
1. **Preserved API**: External classes can continue to use the same methods
2. **Encapsulation**: Implementation details are hidden behind the Player interface
3. **Flexibility**: Components can be changed without affecting external code
4. **Maintainability**: Clear delegation pattern makes the code easier to understand

## Future Improvements
1. Complete the refactoring of direct property access in all classes
2. Add JSDoc comments to document the delegation methods
3. Consider using TypeScript interfaces to formalize the API
4. Add unit tests to verify the delegation methods work correctly
