# CSS Refactoring Summary

## Task Completed
Refactored the `css/ui.css` file into two separate modular files:

1. `css/core/hud-manager.css` - Contains all in-game HUD elements:
   - Player stats container and info
   - Health and mana bars
   - Enemy health display
   - Skills container and buttons
   - Virtual joystick
   - Home/settings button
   - Update notification

2. `css/core/menu-system.css` - Contains all menu and UI components:
   - Dialog components
   - Inventory components
   - Game menu
   - Settings menu and layout
   - Model preview layouts
   - Controls info styling
   - Camera controls
   - Loading screen
   - Menu buttons and styling
   - Form elements (select, buttons)

## Next Steps
1. Update the main.css file to import these new modular files instead of ui.css
2. Remove the duplicate imports of ui.css in main.css
3. Consider further modularization of other CSS files if needed

## Benefits
- Better organization of CSS code
- Improved maintainability
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Easier to locate and modify specific UI components
- Reduced file sizes for faster loading
