# Simplified Save Game UI

## Overview
This update simplifies the game saving process by removing the complex UI progress indicators and replacing them with a simple notification message. This makes the game saving process less intrusive and easier for players to understand.

## Changes Made

1. Modified `SaveManager.js` to remove the progress UI during save operations:
   - Removed all progress indicator UI elements from the `saveGame` method
   - Simplified the save process to just show a notification when complete
   - Maintained all the core save functionality

2. Updated `saveWorldChunksWithProgress` method:
   - Removed all progress UI references
   - Maintained the core functionality of saving world chunks
   - Reduced delay times to improve performance

## Benefits

- **Improved Player Experience**: Players no longer see a complex UI when saving the game, making the experience less intrusive
- **Simplified Feedback**: A simple notification message is shown when the save is complete
- **Maintained Functionality**: All save functionality is preserved, ensuring game progress is still properly saved

## Technical Details

The save process now works as follows:
1. When a save is triggered (manually or automatically), the game collects all necessary data
2. The data is saved to local storage without showing a progress UI
3. A simple notification message is shown when the save is complete
4. If an error occurs, an error notification is shown

This change makes the save process feel more seamless and integrated into the game experience.
