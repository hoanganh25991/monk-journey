# Enhanced Combo Punch System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a sophisticated combo punch system for the player character that uses both hands with a 1-2-3 combo pattern. The third punch is a powerful finisher that knocks enemies back. Each punch in the combo has unique animations, visual effects, and damage calculations.

## Changes Made

### Player.js
1. Replaced the basic auto-punch with a combo system:
   - Added `punchSystem` object with properties for tracking combo state, cooldowns, and damage multipliers
   - Implemented combo counter that cycles through 4 states (0-3)
   - Added combo timer to allow players to continue combos within a time window
   - Added knockback functionality for the final punch in the combo

2. Added specialized punch animations for each combo step:
   - `createLeftPunchAnimation()`: Quick jab with left hand
   - `createRightPunchAnimation()`: Strong cross with right hand
   - `createLeftHookAnimation()`: Circular hook with left hand
   - `createHeavyPunchAnimation()`: Powerful uppercut with right hand that includes knockback

3. Enhanced visual effects:
   - Each punch type has a unique color scheme (blue, red, purple, orange-red)
   - Added specialized particle effects for each punch type
   - Created a spectacular fire-based effect for the heavy uppercut
   - Added shockwave effect for the knockback

4. Implemented damage scaling:
   - Each step in the combo deals progressively more damage
   - Final heavy punch deals 80% more damage than the first punch
   - Damage calculation includes player stats, level, and equipment

### Enemy.js
1. Added knockback functionality:
   - Added `isKnockedBack` and `knockbackEndTime` to enemy state
   - Implemented `applyKnockback()` method that handles:
     - Physics-based movement with arc trajectory
     - Tilting animation to show impact
     - Smooth transition back to normal state
   - Modified enemy update logic to pause normal behavior during knockback

2. Enhanced enemy reactions:
   - Enemies tilt in the direction of the knockback
   - Enemies are temporarily stunned during knockback
   - Added vertical arc to knockback movement for more realistic physics

## Combo System Mechanics
- **First Punch (Left Jab)**: Quick, low damage, blue effect
- **Second Punch (Right Cross)**: Medium speed, 10% more damage, red effect
- **Third Punch (Left Hook)**: Medium speed, 30% more damage, purple effect
- **Fourth Punch (Heavy Uppercut)**: Slower but powerful, 80% more damage, fiery effect with knockback

## Knockback Mechanics
- Enemies are pushed back up to 3 units from their original position
- Knockback has a slight upward arc for realistic physics
- Enemies are temporarily stunned during knockback (can't attack or move)
- Visual effects include a shockwave at the impact point
- Enemy models tilt in the direction of the knockback

## Visual Improvements
- Each punch has a unique color scheme and particle effect
- Heavy punch features fire particles, multiple rings, and a larger impact
- Punch effects are positioned differently based on which hand is used
- Torso rotation is included in hook and uppercut animations for realism

## Future Improvements
- Add sound effects specific to each punch type
- Implement critical hit chance that increases with combo length
- Add combo counter UI element
- Create special combo finishers for longer combos
