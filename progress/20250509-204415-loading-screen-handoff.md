# Loading Screen Handoff to main.js

## Summary
Modified the loading screen system to allow main.js to handle the final initialization steps. The loading screen now shows 100% progress when assets are loaded and then passes control to main.js, which updates the loading screen one final time before immediately hiding it.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `initial-load-progress.js`
- Updated the `finishLoading` function to:
  - Show 100% progress with "Initializing game engine..." message
  - Expose the loading screen instance globally via `window.gameLoadingScreen`
  - Dispatch a custom event `gameAssetsLoaded` with loading time and file size details
  - No longer automatically hide the loading screen
- Updated the simulated progress tracking to match this behavior

### 2. Enhanced `main.js`
- Added an event listener for the `gameAssetsLoaded` event
- Implemented a `handleAssetsLoaded` function that:
  - Updates the loading screen with "Executing game.start()..." message
  - Immediately hides the loading screen since the game menu will be shown when game initialization is successful

## Benefits
- Better separation of concerns: loading screen handles asset loading progress, main.js handles game initialization
- More consistent user experience with smoother transition from loading to game start
- Allows main.js to control when the loading screen is hidden based on actual game initialization status
- No unnecessary delay before showing the game menu

## Testing Notes
- Verify that the loading screen shows 100% when assets are loaded
- Confirm that main.js receives the `gameAssetsLoaded` event and updates the loading screen
- Check that the loading screen is immediately hidden after the final initialization message
- Verify that the game menu appears as soon as game initialization is complete
