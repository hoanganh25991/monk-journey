# CSS Refactoring - Layout File

## Summary
Refactored the CSS structure by moving the `layout.css` file from the root CSS directory to the `css/core/` directory to better organize the codebase.

## Changes Made
1. Created a new file at `css/core/layout.css` with the content from the original `layout.css`
2. Updated the import statement in `main.css` to reference the new location:
   - Changed `@import 'layout.css';` to `@import 'core/layout.css';`

## Rationale
This refactoring improves the organization of the CSS files by:
- Grouping related core layout styles with other core CSS files
- Following a more consistent directory structure
- Making the codebase more maintainable

## Next Steps
- Consider further organizing CSS files by functionality
- Review other CSS files for potential refactoring
- Ensure all imports are correctly referenced in the main.css file
