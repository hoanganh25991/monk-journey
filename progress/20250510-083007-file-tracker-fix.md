# File Tracker Fix

## Issue
The file-tracker.js script was encountering a reference error: `ReferenceError: downloadedFiles is not defined` at line 110. This was preventing the file tracking system from working correctly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Variable Reference in file-tracker.js
- Changed references from non-existent `downloadedFiles` and `cachedFiles` variables to the correctly defined `allDownloadedFiles` and `allCachedFiles` variables.
- This ensures that the file tracking system can properly track files that were loaded before the file-sizes.json data was fetched.

### 2. Enhanced generate-file-sizes.js Script
- Added additional metadata to the generated file-sizes.json:
  - Category statistics for better reporting
  - Timestamp for cache validation
  - Complete list of all files for easier tracking
- These enhancements provide more context for the file tracking system and improve debugging capabilities.

## Benefits
- Fixed the reference error that was breaking the file tracking functionality
- Improved the file-sizes.json format with additional useful metadata
- Enhanced the file tracking system's ability to report on loading progress

## Testing
- Successfully ran the generate-file-sizes.js script to create an updated file-sizes.json
- The script reported 157 total files with a size of 9.95 MB
- The file tracking system should now work correctly without reference errors
