# Wave Skill Effect Fix

## Overview
This update fixes issues with the Wave Skill Effect implementation, particularly for the "Wave of Light" skill. The implementation now properly handles error cases and includes extensive logging to help diagnose any remaining issues.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Error Handling in WaveSkillEffect.js
1. Added comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout the implementation
2. Added detailed logging to track the execution flow
3. Implemented fallback mechanisms when errors occur
4. Fixed potential null reference issues in the animation code

### Improved SkillEffectFactory.js
1. Enhanced logging to track skill effect creation
2. Added more detailed console output for debugging purposes

## Technical Details
- The WaveSkillEffect now properly handles cases where components might be missing
- The _createWaveEffect method has been split into multiple try-catch blocks to ensure partial rendering even if some parts fail
- The update and animation methods now check for null/undefined values before accessing properties
- All error cases now log detailed information to help with debugging

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with the "Wave of Light" skill (key 6) and should now properly display the wave effect. The console logs provide detailed information about the execution flow and any errors that might occur.

## Next Steps
- Monitor the console for any remaining errors
- Consider optimizing the particle count if performance issues arise
- Add specific sound effects for the Wave of Light skill
