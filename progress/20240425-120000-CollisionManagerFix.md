# CollisionManager Bug Fix

## Issue Description
The game was throwing an error in the CollisionManager.js file:
```
CollisionManager.js:70 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')
    at CollisionManager.checkPlayerObjectCollisions (CollisionManager.js:70:28)
    at CollisionManager.update (CollisionManager.js:16:14)
    at Game.animate (Game.js:244:31)
    at Game.js:217:42
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the `CollisionManager` was trying to access `this.world.objects.forEach()`, but the `objects` property doesn't exist in the `WorldManager` class. The code was likely written assuming that the `World` class had an `objects` array, but the architecture had changed to use a more modular approach with separate managers for different types of objects.

## Solution
Modified the `checkPlayerObjectCollisions()` method in `CollisionManager.js` to:

1. Check if the required properties exist before trying to access them
2. Use the `structures` array from the `structureManager` instead of the non-existent `objects` array
3. Added null checks to prevent similar errors in the future

## Changes Made
- Updated `CollisionManager.js` to safely access the structures collection
- Added proper null checking to prevent similar errors
- Maintained the same collision detection logic but with the correct object reference

## Testing
The fix should resolve the TypeError and allow the collision detection system to work properly with the structures in the game world.
