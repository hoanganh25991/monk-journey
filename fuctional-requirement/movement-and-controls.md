# Movement and Controls Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and specifications for the development of movement and control mechanics in the game. The movement and control system is crucial for providing players with a seamless and intuitive gameplay experience, allowing them to navigate the game world and interact with various elements effectively.

## Objectives

- Implement a responsive and intuitive control scheme for player movement.
- Ensure smooth navigation within a 3D environment using Three.js.
- Provide players with a variety of movement options to enhance gameplay dynamics.

## Technical Specifications

### 1. Movement Mechanics

#### 1.1. Basic Movement
- **Directional Movement**: Allow players to move in all directions (forward, backward, left, right) using keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D).
- **Camera Control**: Implement mouse control for camera rotation to provide a full 360-degree view of the environment.

#### 1.2. Advanced Movement
- **Dashing**: Enable a quick dash movement to evade attacks or close distances, activated by a specific key (e.g., Shift).
- **Jumping**: Implement a jump mechanic to navigate over obstacles or reach elevated areas.

#### 1.3. Environmental Interaction
- **Climbing**: Allow players to climb certain surfaces or objects to access new areas.
- **Swimming**: Implement swimming mechanics for water-based environments, with appropriate controls for diving and surfacing.

### 2. Control Scheme

#### 2.1. Keyboard Controls
- **Movement**: W, A, S, D for directional movement.
- **Dash**: Shift key for quick dashing.
- **Jump**: Spacebar for jumping.
- **Interact**: E key for interacting with objects or NPCs.

#### 2.2. Mouse Controls
- **Camera Rotation**: Mouse movement for rotating the camera view.
- **Skill Activation**: Left and right mouse buttons for activating primary and secondary skills.

#### 2.3. User Interface Controls
- **Menu Navigation**: Arrow keys or mouse clicks for navigating menus.
- **Skill Selection**: Number keys (1-5) for selecting and activating skills from the skill bar.

### 3. Visual and Audio Feedback

#### 3.1. Visual Indicators
- **Movement Trails**: Implement subtle visual trails to indicate movement direction and speed.
- **Dash Effects**: Use visual effects to highlight dashing movements, such as motion blur or speed lines.

#### 3.2. Sound Design
- **Footstep Sounds**: Include distinct sounds for different surfaces (e.g., grass, stone, water) to enhance immersion.
- **Dash Sounds**: Add sound effects for dashing to provide auditory feedback.

### 4. User Interface

#### 4.1. Movement HUD
- **Mini-Map**: Display a mini-map to assist with navigation and orientation.
- **Objective Markers**: Show markers for objectives or points of interest on the HUD.

#### 4.2. Control Customization
- **Key Remapping**: Allow players to customize key bindings for movement and actions.
- **Sensitivity Settings**: Provide options to adjust mouse sensitivity for camera control.

## Art and Aesthetics

### 5. Visual Style
- **Character Animation**: Ensure smooth and realistic animations for all movement types.
- **Environment Design**: Create visually distinct environments that complement movement mechanics.

### 6. Sound Design
- **Ambient Sounds**: Include ambient sounds that reflect the environment and enhance the sense of place.
- **Action Sounds**: Add sounds for actions like jumping, climbing, and interacting with objects.

## Testing and Validation

### 7. Testing
- **Usability Testing**: Conduct tests to ensure controls are intuitive and responsive.
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the performance of movement mechanics in various environments to ensure smooth gameplay.

### 8. Feedback
- **Player Feedback**: Gather feedback from playtesters to identify areas for improvement.
- **Iteration**: Continuously refine movement and control mechanics based on feedback and testing results.
