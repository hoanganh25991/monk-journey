# Terrain Z-Fighting Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The terrain was experiencing z-fighting causing flickering between yellow and black colors, similar to old TV static. This was happening because:

1. **Base terrain** was created at position (0, 0, 0) covering the entire world
2. **Terrain chunks** were also being positioned at y=0, creating overlapping surfaces
3. Both surfaces at the exact same height were competing for rendering priority

## Root Cause
- Z-fighting occurs when multiple surfaces exist at the same or very similar depth
- The GPU can't determine which surface should be rendered on top
- This causes rapid switching between surfaces, creating the flickering effect

## Solution Applied

### 1. Disabled Base Terrain Creation
- Modified `init()` method to skip `createBaseTerrain()` call
- Updated `createBaseTerrain()` method to be disabled with explanatory comments
- The chunked terrain system now handles all terrain rendering

### 2. Added Height Offset to Chunks
- Modified chunk positioning from `y: 0` to `y: 0.001`
- This tiny offset prevents any potential z-fighting between chunks
- The offset is negligible for gameplay but prevents rendering conflicts

### 3. Added Legacy Cleanup
- Enhanced `clear()` method to properly dispose of base terrain if it exists
- This ensures clean migration from the old system to the new one

## Files Modified
- `js/world/terrain/TerrainManager.js`

## Changes Made
1. **Line 57-58**: Removed base terrain creation, added explanatory comment
2. **Line 74-76**: Disabled base terrain creation method with comments
3. **Line 261**: Changed chunk position from `(worldX, 0, worldZ)` to `(worldX, 0.001, worldZ)`
4. **Line 566-571**: Added base terrain cleanup in clear() method

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more terrain flickering
- ✅ Consistent terrain colors
- ✅ Maintained 120 FPS performance
- ✅ Proper terrain chunk loading and unloading
- ✅ Clean system without overlapping surfaces

## Technical Details
- Z-fighting eliminated by removing surface overlap
- Chunked terrain system now exclusively handles all terrain rendering
- Tiny height offset (0.001) prevents any remaining z-fighting issues
- Proper cleanup ensures no memory leaks from old base terrain
